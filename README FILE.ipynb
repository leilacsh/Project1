    "## Background\n",
    "Singapore is a densely populated island city-state that is known for its world-class infrastructure, high standard of living, and booming real estate market. One of the most popular types of housing in Singapore is the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat, which is a government-subsidized apartment that is affordable for many Singaporeans. In recent years, the resale market for HDB flats has become increasingly competitive, with prices fluctuating based on a variety of factors such as location, age of the flat, and nearby amenities. Linear regression is a statistical modeling technique that can be used to predict HDB resale prices based on these factors, allowing buyers and sellers to make more informed decisions in this dynamic market. By analyzing past sales data and building a linear regression model, it is possible to forecast HDB resale prices with a certain level of accuracy, helping to mitigate risk and uncertainty in the buying and selling process.\n"

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale market in Singapore is a significant contributor to the real estate industry. The HDB resale price is influenced by various factors such as location, age of the property, floor area, lease remaining, and many others. The aim of this project is to develop a linear regression model that predicts the resale price of HDB flats based on these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains information about past HDB resale transactions, including the flat type, town, flat model, floor area, lease commencement date, and resale price. The objective is to create a model that accurately predicts the resale price of HDB flats based on the given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for the model will be the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which measures the difference between the predicted and actual prices. A lower RMSE indicates better accuracy and precision of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's outcome will be a linear regression model that can predict HDB resale prices with minimal errors and high accuracy. The model can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions based on the estimated prices."

    "Correlation shows that only 5 independent variables have correlation of more than 0.4 absolute value with resale price. Hence, the threshold is adjusted to 0.3 in order to capture more variables and investigate further their relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the higher the flat size (represent by flat type and floor area) and height (represented by max floor level) , the higher the resale price. Resale price also tend to be higher with new houses (represented by year completed  and lease_commence date in a positive number and hdb age in a negative number).\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables \"upper\", \"mid\", \"lower\" correlation with resale price is vague as they have similar correlation with resale price. As these variables are the same thing with storey range, we will ignore these variables in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, it shows the higher the number of 3-room residential units in the resale flat, the lower the resale price. This can be explained better by comparison with \"5room_sold\" and \"exec_sold\", they represent that the more bigger size flats in the resale unit's block, the higher the resale price. This applies to the case for 3room_sold in an opposite way.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, floor_area_sqm and floor_area_sqft are raising multicollinearity problem (represent in dark green) because they both have equally strong correlation with resale price. Hence, only floor_area_sqm is used in this model. Although floor_area_sqm is highly correlated with flat_type_encoded, both are still included in the model because floor_area_sqm is continuos variable, it could be more accurate in terms of modelling prediction.\n",

    "Similarly, year_completed, lease_commence_date and hdb_age are highly correlated (represented by maroon color). Therefore, hdb age is included in the model only.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Most of the resale flat are sold at 100sgd per sqm or 1000sgd per sqft.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The dependent/target variable (resale price) has a distribution slightly skewed to the right with mean price $449k. That means some of the resale flat are sold at extremely high price. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The transaction volume was increasing until 2020, followed by a sudden drop. Also, it is found that buyers tend to transact in Dec and Jan comparing to other months.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The range of storey of the resale flat sold is 1-13 storey. This could be the reason that the max floor of a HDB block is usually in range of 12-16 storeys.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Among the resale flat sold, most are aged 20 and 35. Decreasing transaction volume happened once the hdb age exceeded 35.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Resale flat typically has 100-180 unit in the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Most resale flat do not have 1room, 2 room, executive, multi-generation, studio apartment types in the same block. The most common room type is 4 room, following by 5 room and 3 room. Also, usually the resale flat does not have any rental unit in the same block.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Half of the resale flats do not have any mall within 2km. The other half usually can see 2-8 malls in 2km (among this, one-third of them can at least see 1 mall within 500m). \n",
    "\n",
    "9) Only one-third of the resale flat has 1-2 hawker centre within 500m. Most of them are able to see at least 1 hawker within 1km with around 40 food stalls in it, but without market stalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Most of the HDB sold are nearer to bus-interchange, comparing to train-interchange. While bus stop typically located within 100m.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Resale flat usually is 700m from nearest primary school (with vacancy range of 40-65) and secondary school (with most of their cutoff point less than 200)."

For 5 room and executive number in the block, the linear relationship is very weak, and is capture at the lower bound of the resale price only.

    "Flat model is the most influential variables in determination of resale price. Among the model, hdb terrace stand out to be the first that has highest sensitivity to the resale price. Hdb terrace was last built in the 1960s, with 99 year lease. It is a landed properties with a backyard, hence with a bigger built up area. The reason terrace flat model is sensitive to resale price are firstly, this is a rare model landed property that has much reasonable price compared to private landed house. Secondly, buyers could be looking for an en bloc windfall (Property Guru Editorial Team, 2021). However, Ryan (2021) highlighted that the hdb terrace might have higher depreciation rate as it near the last 20-30 year lease, mainly due to financing issue. Hence, it is worth noting that the prediction power of resale price for this flat model in the future might turn weaker.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ridge model shows a large coefficient positively related between mrt and resale price, and a large coefficient negatively related between pri sch and resale price. The plot below clearly shows the location of the different latitudes in Singapore. The larger the mrt latitude, towards the cluster at the north region, the higher resale price we can expect. This means that the higher resale price in north region is mainly due to the variable mrt. This could probably explained by Eugenia (2020) article that those regions with less accessibility tend to have greater appreciation with the opening of new mrt. Comparing to central region which are already high priced due to its prime location and better serviced by more bus routes and mrt stations, resale price in central region will have lower impact by the nearby mrt. The higher resale price is represented by darker color intensity. Therefore, the reason central region has higher resale price must be due to other variables.\n",

    "Ridge model using K-best feature selection is the best model to predict the price of HDB resale flat with minimal errors and high accuracy, represented by highest R2 score and lowest RMSE. This model has been significantly improved from baseline model that has 44% R2 score and the models with lesser variables selected during EDA process that has 77% accuracy score.\n",

    "Ridge model trades variance for bias. It is usually better than OLS when there are a large number of variables included because it has a penalty term to reduce overfitting and improve generalization to the testing set. However, one should notice that these two models have the same R2 score and just a few cents difference in average prediction error (RMSE). Both are working well and it mean that the variables included are mostly important and no overfitting, so penalizing effect imposed from ridge model is rather weak. This could also mean that the prediction power still has room for improvement by adding more variables to capture more signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge model has lesser error compared to Lasso model is because Lasso tends to work well when there are only a handful of true predictors. Since in this case the selected variables are appropriate, its penalty effect to reduce coefficients that are highly correlated into zero turns the model to have higher variance than other models as it missing some important signals. This is the limitation of LASSO where it is unable to do group selection. If there is a group of variables among which the pairwise correlations are very high, then the LASSO tends to arbitrarily select only one variable from the group. That is the reason it turns most of the one-hot encoded variables into zero, and with less signal in the model, it performs slightly worse than Ridge model.\n",

    "In accordance to the coefficients in the best model in this project, the order of importance in ascending order is as follow: flat model (particularly terrance), floor area in sqm, mrt latitude (similar to mrt name), pri school latitude, hdb age, sec school latitude, max floor lvl, hawker within 2km, bus stop latitude, latitude based on postal code, mrt nearest distance, planning area, flat type."

    "## Recommendation and Limitation\n",
    "Although the R2 score is above 80%, there is room for improvement, this could be done by adding model complexity to capture as much signals as possible. One of the recommendation is to include GDP and interest rate datasets to analyse the trend of the resale price because macroeconomic factors could have a large impact on resale price. The demand and supply of resale flat and the upward and downward trend in the resale price over the years fluctuates as seen in the EDA process. Additionally, polynomial features should be analysed to examine their combination effect on resale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, target encoding has been applied to mrt name and planning area. It could be improved by taken into consideration the weight based on the count of the groups to be a more accurate indicator. Also, a number of outliers have been observed in the EDA process, and this should be removed or eliminated in order to generalize the effect on resale price. While standard scaler is highly influenced by outliers, robust scaling is recommended for better measurement."
