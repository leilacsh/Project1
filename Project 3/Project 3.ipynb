    "Deafness and blindness are two separate conditions that can affect individuals of all ages and backgrounds.\n",

    "Deafness, also known as hearing loss, is a condition where a person has a partial or complete inability to hear sound in one or both ears. This can be caused by a variety of factors such as genetics, exposure to loud noises, infections, trauma, or simply aging. Deafness can be categorized as conductive, sensorineural, or mixed, depending on which part of the ear is affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blindness, on the other hand, is a condition where a person has little to no ability to see. This can be caused by various factors such as genetics, eye infections, injuries, or diseases such as glaucoma or macular degeneration. Blindness can be categorized as partial or complete, and can occur at any age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deafness and blindness can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, as they can affect communication, mobility, education, and employment opportunities. However, there are many resources and technologies available to help individuals with these conditions, such as sign language interpreters, braille devices, hearing aids, and guide dogs."

In order to better understand the experiences and needs of these communities, I plan to classify subreddits related to deafness and blindness and evaluate the feedback and sentiment of these posts. This will help to identify common themes, concerns, and needs that are specific to these communities, which can inform the development of targeted support groups and resources.\n",

It is also essential to consider sensitivity and specificity in additional to the overall accuracy."

    "In a decision tree, the input data is represented as a set of features, such as word frequencies or presence of certain keywords. The algorithm recursively splits the data into subsets based on the values of the input features, with the goal of maximizing the separation between the classes of interest. The splitting criterion is based on Gini impurity. Once the tree is constructed, new inputs are classified by traversing the tree based on their feature values until a leaf node is reached, which corresponds to a class label.\n",

The gridsearch value to depth is given up to 10, and both vectors has best param at 10. Also, zero alpha in both cases supported the reason. In order to have higher accuracy, the value should be adjusted higher to capture more relationships between the input features and the class labels. Otherwise, random forest might address this depth issue and perform better.\n",

However, it can hardly be explained that 'with higher minimum sample leaf in tfidf vector, the model might not able to capture some underlying patterns in the data, causing lower accuracy/scores.' because there is already overfitting problem, and the lowest parameter given in the gridsearch is 5. The only GUESS i am able to provide is that while Random Forest can auto select the best feature, the frequency of words might give more information to this model, hence performed better. However, this requires proof and further experiments from different datasets. Otherwise, hyperparameter between 5-10 should be added to experiment if tf-idf could work better than count vector by taking the number in between 5-10."

Specifically, Extra Trees constructs multiple decision trees by randomly selecting a subset of features and selecting the split point at each node randomly. This randomization leads to a more diverse set of trees and can improve the performance of the algorithm, particularly in situations where the data is noisy or the feature space is high-dimensional. Generally, Random Forest tends to work better on structured datasets with low to medium dimensionality, while Extra Trees can work better on noisy or high-dimensional datasets.\n",

      "Just a BIIIIG! rant about training my speaking abilities as a born profoundly deaf person (bilateral). I'm just sick of how many rules there are in the English language. I'm already having a rough time rolling my r's and l's and fumble about half of the time (admittedly, not like it's permanent if I work hard enough), and I have an immense hatred for squirrels now... but anyway, it's already bad enough that I have to roll letters which happens in probably every spoken language. I also have to deal with strange out of the norm things with English; like the fucking word \"Tub\". Apparently it's said with a silent 'p'. What's the logics of that? Why not just spell it as \"Tup\" if it's going to be like that. (it feels like it's even worse because of my annoying tendency that I tend to say words before I can fully think the phonetics of them out in my head so it comes out as gibberish the first one or two times, especially when my mind is all over the place as an ADHD sufferer. Plus the whole rolling sounds thing lol)---If I could hear even a tad bit I would have picked up on every nuance probably by now, but since I have no sensory cues to go by, it's very difficult and gets frustrating when I can't get people to understand until I finally just spell the offending word out. Ugh. Another word would maybe be \"Island\". Although I always knew how to say it the right way since in second grade, my teacher had mused on how her hearing and elderly parents had been saying it wrong all their lives (then she explained the proper way to say it to her class full of hearing kids). Bilingual folks and even they hadn't realized! I really want to understand this language. Maybe I'm just being off base with the two examples above and there are legitimate reasons and clauses for those words just not making sense to me, but there really are some words that are just bizarre when you think about it. Too tired to think of any right off the top of my head. Sigh. ---And then when I was moaning over how frustrating it can be to say even a simple word correctly for me; not because of my mechanical ability to speak for the most part... But just.. how misleading English spelt words can be, someone very close to me who helps me train my voice and pronouncing words says, \"Well, it's the same for French too...\" I'm not going to ever learn any other spoken language by voice though, so why do people say things like that? He wasn't trying to be like that, but it just bummed me out even more... it made me feel like I'm just wrong and broken for being frustrated with English words. I know it happens in other languages too. But I've honestly had people who were more multilingual, say that English was trickier for them to speak than other languages. Yeah, this wasn't a small rant. Just... I feel frustrated and tired, I guess, and I'm withdrawing from Xanax too. Yay. **Tldr:** English words are hard for me to learn sometimes because of unexpected wrenches thrown in with some words, pronunciation-wise. Since I've never been able to hear (really want to get a second CI implant tho, yo) it's been hard for me to pick up sensory cues, if not actually impossible. Sigh. ---**Edit:** I continue to be terrible at grammar and I am literally attending a college course in creative writing **Double edit:** I might have made it sound like he was trying to help me feel better because it does happen in multiple languages and it's not just me who struggles. But I had been bitching about specifically the English language. Unkind words might have been said about it... ahem... I was in a frustrated mood and now I know how silly it sounds when framed in a totally rational mindset. But damn. I am so insecure of my \"deaf accent\", and I am also taking baby steps in learning written French. If I had the time to learn more than one spoken language I would. Man... I'm just sad right now. His interjection was just irrelevant to my nonsensical rant. Wow. This turned into a soapbox. I'm sorry, r/deaf. I just wish I could have more than I can have. Bleh. I don't hate my deafness or temporary muteness most of the time, but... it does keep me from doing some of the things I'd love to accomplish... that was just a salt in the wound... yeah, time for me to get off Reddit.Again, sorry. **Hopefully final edit:** I'm weeping internally now.  \n",

      "Any neruodivergents here? Possible TW as I’m going to talk a bit about abuse in school (and in general) for being deaf and ND Hey,I was born severely hoh, I got CI when I was 6 and 7.This also doesn’t help that I’m an afab.I understand being deaf causes language barriers and that can effect your learning, if you don’t have all the correct accommodations. But both my teachers (one specialists with deaf kids and was an interpreter so we saw her to make sure our hearing aids or CI was working along with having a teachers mic etc, the other one was just an interpreter I had every day) kept telling my mom I wasn’t allowed to be tested for any ND conditions even my regular dr wouldn’t get me tested because I’m deaf. My family is very ND (Tourette’s/tic disorders, dyslexia, OCB, ASD, ADHD, and more) so I don’t know why they wouldn’t test me to be sure. Even tho I had every accommodations in the book I still struggled, but no one seemed to think after grade school that maybe I am struggling with something that isn’t social anxiety or depression, but no I was still seen as a terrible person who was attention seeking, it was even harder to talk to my mom, she treated me a lot differently than the rest of my siblings whenever they had issues I truly believe she still thinks I don’t have any issues and I’m just deaf and lazy. The only thing for some reason a deaf person can have is anxiety and or depression. My entire life (and still to this day even drs and neurologist wouldn’t listen to me) I was told my issues can only be from being deaf, anxiety or depression. But half of my symptoms didn’t match with anxiety or being deaf. So I was constantly confused didn’t understand what was happening with me. I was then called many names in the book and backhanded compliments. “You’re just lazy” “pay attention better” “you’re so smart stop messing around and pay attention” “if you don’t start reading or doing your work I’m leaving your desk and I’m not helping you for the rest of the day” Every time I messed up my words or numbers my interpreter would get so mad she went from 0 to 1,000 so fast, she’ll get in my face and scream at me, she’ll hit me and be physically aggressive, she’ll tell me she’ll stop helping me whenever I get stuck on something or even struggling (weather I was able to study or not). no matter how much I tried explaining but again I’m in grade school I can barely comprehend what disorders, conditions and symptoms fully were. This caused a lot of issues. I was later diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome at 17. My Tourette’s causes learning delays which I think is either a learning disorder or an unspecified one, dysinhabition, meltdowns I mostly had rage meltdowns, tourettic hyperactivity, tourettic attention deficit, tourettic social deficits, executive dysfunction, inconsistent performance, handwriting deficits similar to dysgraphia, struggles getting thoughts onto paper and so much more. People still don’t believe me about my tourettic symptoms and still tries telling me it’s just because I’m deaf, anxious or lazy. Biggest question is, how do you get the right dr? I’m looking into getting tested for dyslexia and dyscalula. I need accommodations (to get a job) and it’d be nice when people start supporting me but I doubt that’ll even happen. I just don’t understand why I would put myself through so much when I had all the accommodations to help me.Did anyone struggle with this and how were you able to get tested for your ND symptoms and or learning disorders. \n",

      "Looking for opinions/suggestions/advice on how to help my deaf mother Hi all.  I have a bit of a dilemma with my mother and I'm not entirely sure how to deal with it.  Just to give some quick background info... I'm a 30y/o guy and my mother's 60.  She divorced my biological father when I was 2.  Her and her parents raised me for the most part.  I had a great childhood, and my mom and I have a good relationship, however... I'm not sure how to deal with the array of issues she's been having lately.  To give a brief history of my mom.... she was born with a profound hearing loss, doesn't know sign language, and reads lips.  She got cochlear implants about 5 years ago and has adapted to them very well, I can now have a conversation with her while she's facing the complete opposite direction (pretty awesome!).  So here's the issue... my mom throws \"temper tantrums\", a lot.  It happens almost every single day.  She will scream at people, very very loudly, like \"top of her lungs\" type screaming, but then if anyone shows any remote amount of hostility/aggression back at her she gets even more upset.  Once she finally calms down, one of the things she always says is something along the lines of \"Well he started yelling at me first!\" even though she is the one that initiates the confrontations almost every time.  I would also like to point out that this screaming wasn't really directed at me very often, unless I actually did something I wasn't supposed to do as a kid or something.She also does things like this.... a few years ago her and I went shopping for Christmas presents for her dogs (don't ask, it's just a tradition we've had since I was like 5). While shopping, the store clerk came up and asked if we needed any help.  She completely ignored him, so I responded with \"No thanks, we're fine\" or something along that line.  She then turns to me, and right in front of the clerk says rather loudly... \"I know he was talking to me, I don't need you to answer for me, I was just ignoring him\".  I'm really not exaggerating the way she phrased it.  It was strict, stern, and completely rude.  However, she doesn't seem to think that there's anything wrong with it.  She has confided in me multiple times that she feels that \"she can't hear, so it's the other persons job to understand that she can't hear, and if they can't understand that she can't hear, then they just have to deal with being ignored\" (Even if it's a random stranger that might not know she can't hear, she just expects everyone to know she can't, or else)  She's explained to me before that she feels this way because she's tired of having to \"make all the effort\".Look, I can't imagine how hard it is for her, or what she goes through on a daily basis, but I really feel like what she's doing is wrong, and she's doing it multiple times every day.  She'll do things like back out of a parking spot... a car will be coming... that car will honk... my mom won't stop (even though she hears the honk, she even admitted it) and then she just waits for the other person to get pissed off so she can yell at them and tell them she can't hear and it's their fault because it can't possibly be her fault because she's deaf and they should know that.  It's quite ridiculous.I've been in the car with her and have literally seen her bait people into this kind of thing.Her logic seems twisted with a lot of things anymore... she has actually even admitted to me that she yells because she knows she can get away with it because she's deaf and she knows she can always say \"well I can't hear myself so I don't know how loud I'm being\". I know she's lying, she knows she's lying, but she seems to think that it makes up for all the \"unfairness\" that she's had to deal with.One more thing that she is constantly complaining about is that nobody listens to her.  She's always claiming to be an excellent communicator and doesn't understand why people don't listen as well as she does.  The reality is, it's pretty much the opposite, and she's always getting into (VERY LOUD!!!) arguments with people about them not listening to her.Here's a (fake) example of my mom complaining that I'm not listening to her... She'll say something that isn't very clear, such as \"Hey B, can you go turn the stove on to high for the potatoes with the microwave?\"  So... I go turn the stove on \"high\" and get the potatoes ready... then ignore the microwave part because I don't really know how that applies to cooking the potatoes like we were talking about earlier.  I just assume that she misspoke like everyone does occasionally and that she really just wants me to take care of the potatoes.  However, I'll get an \"I SAID WITH THE MICROWAVE, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME\" for not understanding what she said.  She thinks she's communicating effectively and that other people aren't listening, but that's not really what's happening.  On the other side of her complaints about listening, she continuously chooses to ignore people and her defense is always \"well I didn't hear you\".  I know she's ignoring people, she admits it, and I see it all the time.  I know when my mom hears something and when she doesn't (most of the time). So... this has led to a lot of problems as you can imagine, and I think she's actually remained a bit oblivious as to why things are they way they are for her now.  She hasn't been able to keep any friends longer than a month or so, her mother rarely talks to her anymore, her husband has become an alcoholic (not violent, just drinks a lot and sits and reads or watches TV) and now she's getting upset even more frequently because none of these people are being \"fair\" to her when she \"gives and gives and gives\" to everyone else but receives no love in return.  It's always the other persons fault.  She doesn't seem to grasp the fact that it's hard to show that you love a person when that person's upset and yelling at you and blaming you for everything every day.So... I know that's a lot.... but here's MY problem.  Every time she gets upset, she comes to me for advice.  I live close to her, so I'm pretty much \"readily available\" to her whenever she has a problem, which has been very often.  I don't mind sitting and listening to her most of the time, but she always seeks feedback.  When I was younger (We've been having these conversations since I was 11 or so) I used to always side with her, because she was my mom and I didn't want her to be upset. As I've gotten older I've fought back sometimes and defended other people, but then she would just get mad at me for not \"understanding\".  Finally, one day about 6 months ago on my grandmother's birthday, my mom started screaming at my grandma over something silly.  Everyone around heard my mom say \"Put a fork in the dish with the potatoes\" so my grandma put a fork in the dish... apparently it was supposed to be a spoon. My mom's sitting there screaming and yelling extremely loudly at my grandma on her 82nd birthday for putting a fork in a dish instead of a spoon and \"not listening to her\".  I mean... come on.  Anyway, I grabbed my mom by the arm (not roughly, just to get her attention), she spun quickly toward me, became very red in the face and started screaming at me about \"how dare I lay a hand on her\" and \"what is wrong with you people? can't you pay attention for just ONE MINUTE?!\".  That was the last straw for me (She does this every holiday, literally, every one, for some reason.) I yelled (and I never, ever, ever yell because I've grown to hate it sooooo very much).  I literally yelled for about 5 minutes straight, and told her \"what I really thought\".  I brought up all the times I listened to her and placated her when she was upset EVEN THOUGH it was her own fault the vast majority of the time. I brought up how F'd up it was to yell at her own mother on her 82nd birthday for putting the wrong utensil in a dish.  I pointed out basically everything I think is wrong with her and I was really, really, harsh.  When I was done, she just stared at me... it SEEMED like a moment of realization for her... her eyes seemed to say \"yeah, I know I do all of those things and I feel bad about it\".  My step-father just stood there staring too, he never really stands up to her, because it just makes the argument worse if he doesn't just give in.  My grandma was just kind of shaking her head like \"this shouldn't be happening\".  Since then my mom has been overly nice to me almost all the time (I think she's kind of afraid of losing the one good friend and confidant that she still has), but she's still having these same problems with everyone else, and she's still always getting upset, and still always asking me for advice.  I've tried to (nicely) reiterate that maybe she should be a little more introspective and consider how she might do things differently, or that it might be her fault some of the time, but she won't hear any of it.  She doesn't really seem to understand when I explain to her why people react the way they do when she treats them like she does.This whole thing isn't a terrible burden on me personally, but I see my whole family (my mom, grandma, and stepfather) as very unhappy and I hate it. I think we're all just really tired of being around her because of the way she acts.  I know all relationships have issues and some of this is a natural part of the mother/son, husband/wife, mother/daughter, relationship dynamic, but I think the 3 of us have grown to really resent her for this, and blame her for kind of breaking up the family.  It doesn't affect me as much because I have my own stuff going on, but my grandma doesn't have anyone else really, and my step-father's become miserable over this.I decided to post this on /deaf/ because I'm not really looking for a therapist or doctor's advice (I've already done that a few times), what I'm really looking for are opinions from other deaf people or family/friends of deaf people.  Do you find yourself feeling like she does often?  How do/would you handle it?  I want to be flat out honest with her about what I think when she asks for feedback, because I'm sick of her unwillingness to admit fault when I and other feel that she's the root cause of these problems, but at the same time, she doesn't tend to direct it at me.  If my grandma and stepfather haven't been willing to stand up for themselves, but will talk about it with me when she's not around, should I even bother and risk potentially ruining my relationship with my mom or say \"it's not my problem\"?I want to set the record straight, I want things to be right, but it's a delicate situation of course, so I'm trying to gather analogies and information before I make a decision.  Any thoughts/comments would be appreciated, thank you for reading! \n",

It's irrational and I'm getting treatment for it, but during the times when my mental health was really bad I lurked on this sub because some part of me thought that if I could \"prepare\" for the experience I could handle the grief and tragedy that everyone who lost sight later in life had to inevitably face. So I learned about a lot of things your community has to endure, but the one that broke my heart was all of the dehumanization and condescension that ignorant sighted people give to blind people. From ridiculous things like getting it confused with deafness, asking how you wipe your ass, thinking your cane is a weapon, it was all just incredibly rude bullshit I know I'd hate to put up with. I have temper issues and get angered or depressed due to anxiety very easily. I think the one thing that scared me about being blind even more than the practical problems was how other people would treat me.I have a close friend who is completely blind due to physical trauma severing her optic nerve at a young age. I met her in college before my OCD ever got really bad, and nowadays I don't talk about whatever's bothering me much since no one really seems to get it outside of my therapist. She's been my most loyal friend and I've felt like more than anyone else in my life she \"gets\" a lot of my issues even if she's never experienced them herself (she doesn't have any mental health conditions, though). So whenever she talks about dealing with difficult people I get mad that someone's been treating my friend that way.I heard a lot of stories of the \"Let me pray for you,\" variety from well-meaning but ignorant Christians and it's so embarrassing to me as a Christian. I want to take the opportunity to apologize on behalf of my fellow Christians for their completely inappropriate behavior and lack of understanding of why disabled people are even healed at all in the Gospels (which is another subject not meant for this thread) and why it doesn't happen anymore. I don't fully know the answers to these questions myself, but my relationship with Jesus was never contingent on Him healing me, even though I've got several debilitating conditions myself.But I always thought the \"Let me pray for you\" stuff was just exaggerated on Reddit. I didn't think I'd actually witness it. But today I did.We were with our church (as far as I know nobody at my church has ever asked that infamous question) volunteering at a soup kitchen. I was entering data in a computer (not really what I had expected to be doing but I was doing it nevertheless) and I could overhear what was going on in the next room. My friend had arrived a bit later than everyone else (someone else from church took her) and I hadn't expected her at all. She's very much into volunteering when she can, and I never asked her how she had to go about doing that when most people are unfamiliar with blind people and probably automatically assume they can't help out with anything. We had gotten most of the work done much quicker than we had expected so there wasn't much for her to do anyway. Regardless, someone from the soup kitchen approached and talked to her. I was too focused on my work to listen to most of the conversation, but I heard what the worst of it. I'm not even sure if the guy asked \"Can I pray for you?\" so much as insisted on praying anyway, and then of course asking in a piteous tone how she had lost her sight.My friend came to see me when she was told I was working in the back and I told her I had heard what happened. She assured me I didn't need to be bothered by it because she was used to it and just felt more awkward than angry. Well, since it's the first time I've seen it happen I'm just incredibly disappointed to find out that what you guys were saying is true. I was hoping this was just a rare occurrence. Honestly, how my friend can even still be a Christian after having to put up with things like that all the time. I hate that a few Christians somewhere have done something that makes whole groups of people resent Christianity because the Christians focused more on this literalist, simplistic understanding of a few cherry-picked Scriptures rather than actually looking at real life and realizing that Christ's kingdom isn't just about winning souls, but bringing forth a kingdom of God and humanity working together to restore the world to the perfect creation it was always meant to be, and sometimes the miracles just aren't meant to happen in this life. There's dozens of issues I have that I'd certainly like to be miraculously healed of, but I trust God to have His own reasons for shaping my life the way He did. It's not always easy but I endure because I have hope in something better.I apologize if me as a sighted person getting upset on my friend's behalf is somehow inappropriate. I'm willing to be corrected on how to better react if need be. I'm just crushed that I actually got to see the kind of thing that makes Redditors dislike Christianity, because I thought that I'd never witness it. \n",

      "Sight Explained Via the Senses Staring at the sun is like a burning spicy pepper on your tongue, too intense, your eyes want to get away from it, cannot stand it for long, only a moment, like sipping too hot water, the reaction is automatic.Colors are much like temperatures; an object with the same shape can be hot or cold, just like an object could be red or blue or anything in-between. Because fire is red, we think of red as a hot color, and because ocean and night are blue, we think of it as a cold color.Night or darkness, when it is so dark you cannot see, is like being in an unfamiliar room and unable to feel anything around you despite trying. Each moment you feel like surely you must find a wall or a couch, yet can feel nothing.Seeing a scene is like having arms and fingers of infinite length, thousands of them, they can stretch out from my body at lightning speed and touch everything around me, telling me exactly how far away they are and what shape they are, and where they’re moving or going. To feel all that at once, may seem overwhelming, but it must be like what it is to know a room so well that you know where everything is in space. That sense in your mind of where everything is without needing to touch it, that is a kind of sight. Sight lets you do that exact thing, build that setup of the room in your mind, but without needing to touch everything first.Light flows into the eye as smoothly as water past your hand, sight is effortless, and the eye’s hunger for light is never satisfied. The eye does not like to be denied light.Touch can do things sight cannot, can feel the back of an object--sight can only sense the front, everything behind something is hidden, but touch can find it out. Sometimes the eye is fooled where the hand could not be because of this.Sometimes the eye can be fooled, tricked, in myriad ways, it can see things that aren’t there, much as if someone handed you what they said was an eyeball but was actually a peeled grape or a hardboiled egg, you might be fooled. Or I might see a shadow against a lighter background in the night, like feeling a scratchy texture next to a smooth one, and think it the shadow of a person or a creature, for a moment. Perhaps that could be like running your hand along a textured wall and feeling like at times braille words are written there, but there are none.Some sights are like music, colors blending into each other so beautifully and richly, like a gorgeous sonata conducted by a master. Like a beautiful sunrise, colors flow into color smoothly, like one musical note can blend into another, exactly like that, without distinct edges to the notes nor the colors. What is amazing about sight is how precise it is, seeing so many details all at once. Actually it is an illusion, only the very center of vision can see fine detail as if you were touching something directly, and everything around that center is seen only indirectly and indistinctly, mere colors and shapes without the central spot of perfect clarity, like trying to feel something through a sweater perhaps, missing the details of it.But the clarity of vision is incredible, able to see each of ten thousand hairs on my arm with a glance and almost all at once, able to see every key on my keyboard, but only focus on the details of one or two.The bright sun to the eye may be like too-hot heat to the skin, something you feel you must get away from immediately, something you enjoy only indirectly like the warm glow of a fire rather than its flame, even causing pain in the eye from the intensity of it, but darkness is not like cold, darkness does not hurt the eye. Instead total darkness feels suffocating somehow,  like a blanket wrapped around the whole of you, choking off the air. Sight is so easy we come to rely on it, such that those in darkness are left crouched, barely able to walk, afraid to even step.Sight is hardly like any scents, but in one sense it is, in the intensity of scents. You can understand the difference between intense bright blue and dark blue perhaps by thinking of the faint scent of the sea compared to the strong scent of sea. All colors can be strong or weak like scents. If red is like fire, and blue like water, yellow to me is like a scream or a whistle. Some colors are naturally more vibrant than others, and yellow is the most vibrant of them all, except for white, the sum of all colors. Yellow is piercing then, yet also pleasant. We think of citrus scents and flavors, the lemon, because lemon skins are the purest yellow inside and out. Green is a medium color, between the extremes of blue and red. It is the lukewarm color, room temperature color, the most common color, because the trees and leaves are green. Green has a flavor to me, that of succulent vegetables steaming fresh on a plate, especially broccoli which is a dark green.Things can change very quickly in one’s sight, and the eye catches the smallest movement. In fact the eye draws your attention to movement instantly, is attracted to it. Most things the eye sees it tries to ignore, so as not to overwhelm you, and it does a good job. It might see a thousand things on the street, but if they are the same thousand that were there last time, the eye does not think them important. But if one thing is strange or interesting, it will draw you to it, much as if you heard a strange noise and set out to investigate it, even amongst the din of a dozen other noises that are familiar.Sight can have strange things about it. Sometimes when I think of something strongly and look into the distance, my eyes relax and diverge--instead of looking at the same place they look in different places, causes me to see two of each thing overlapped on each other. The images in each eye suddenly disagree, and my brain doesn’t know how to put them together as one thing, so each eye fights for its version and the images may flutter against each other, various objects appearing and disappearing behind others, or seeming ghostly, there but not there, transparent, like thinking something is there but finding it gone when you go to reach for it.But, when I stop this reverie, the eyes snap back to looking at the same thing, the two things seen become one thing again in my sight, and the image resumes. Eyes can be strange like that!Sight is just one path to the real, that is what sight is. \n",

      "A post-secondary school seems to be wary of me due to my hearing loss and I'm afraid I won't get accepted because of it. Any tips? Hey all! So I've been quite a lurker but finally made an account, mainly because I have a big question due to a situation I haven't faced before and I would appreciate your advice!I'm a 19 year old female in Canada. It was discovered at age two that I was deaf in my left ear, and as time went on, my hearing went up and down in my right ear. I got a hearing aid in grade one as that's when my hearing really went downhill. With a hearing aid, I do very well though! My speech is perfect, it was never an issue; I'd say 90% of people or more who meet me would not suspect at all that I have a hearing impairment. I went through high school with the vast majority of people having no idea I wore a hearing aid and was partially deaf. And no, I do not sign. I recently got a cochlear implant in my left ear and while things are going good, it's slow, and it is work. I don't think I'll ever get to a level where I can close my eyes and have a perfect, full length conversation with someone on my implant alone, but it's far better than nothing and I'm determined to keep working at it! As long as I don't have to deal with a telephone, I typically do just fine on my aid alone.So here's the thing- my whole life I've been treated very normally and was always told that I could do just about anything. I was popular in school, I did extracurricular activities, I was a fantastic student, was never bullied, my hearing was never an issue. I have a huge passion for medicine and caring for others, and I truly believe that nursing is a great fit for me. I took some time off after high school graduation to get the implant and also think about my future, and I've come up with a plan. I'd like to go to a well known tech school in my city, where I'd take an LPN course. An LPN is basically a rank below a registered nurse, LPN's typically work in quieter settings like nursing homes and private doctors offices, and they don't handle the big life-or-death meds that RN's do. I figure I can graduate from the LPN course, work as one for a couple years, and if I want more responsibility I can take two more years of school and become an RN. Or, if I'm happy as an LPN, then I'm happy as an LPN, no prob.So I went to said school recently to speak with someone who handles potential students and gives them info about the classes etc. The program I'm applying for has two seats saved for those who apply as disabled (meaning you don't compete with \"normal\" applicants, just other disability applicants). I could apply as disabled, as it would give me more support and I'd have someone to advocate for me if issues arise in my classes. Anywho, the lady I spoke with said that my grades are just fine, but she came off as though I shouldn't be choosing this as my career at all. She made it sound as though it was a bad choice for someone with a hearing impairment to have a career in nursing. I did explain that I do understand my \"limits\" in hearing, and that upon graduation, I will be choosing a job in, say, a nursing home, or a slow-paced general doctors office, *not* a fast paced, intense life-or-death emergency room. AKA, I'll be choosing a place of work that is based more so on routine, and is a quieter setting; a place where I can afford to say \"pardon me?\" and have people repeat something if need be, just to be on the safe side. Needless to say, she didn't seem too impressed. She gave me the number to the head of the nursing department and said that I can book a meeting with that lady and talk it over with her and see if she recommends I apply to the program at all. I had my mom along with me for this meeting because it was apparently their school policy to have any disabled persons have someone else attend the meeting with them in case they miss something or misinterpret, I don't know. But my mom seemed a bit discouraged. She said that my grades may not even matter, that I could have have a 100 average and they could find some reason to not accept me into the program because of my hearing loss. She could be right, they could absolutely reject me based on my disability, but find a different reason to cover it up. This is also the only school in my province that offers this course. I'd have to drive 6-7 hours to get to the next province that would offer the exact same course, but is run by a different school.I'm planning on booking a meeting with the head of the nursing department soon, but I am definitely discouraged. Medicine and working with people, helping people, is absolutely my passion and is something I would love to do. Combined with the fact that this job is fairly in demand, and is flexible (as in, there's plenty of part time AND full time spots out there) makes it just wonderful. If this head of nursing lady says that I shouldn't be a nurse, I'm not really sure what else to do. I've been banking on this being my career for many years. I love working with people and interacting, if I'm written off as a nurse, doesn't that write off a *lot* more jobs for me? Pretty much every job I'd want to do would be considered not an option then according to this school. I don't think there's another job that I would enjoy, that pays a living wage, that involves medicine or working with kids, and helps others, that I'd be suited for then.I've simply never had my hearing be a barrier. I was in swimming, dance, competitive cheer, I played guitar, I still have a great social life. *I have never had someone say I couldn't do something because of my hearing, I've never had someone be wary of me because of my hearing*. And now I'm here, standing before the school that will **allow me to get a career doing something I love** and they're going \"ehhh…maybe not.\" What do you guys think about this? I've read on here that deaf individuals have been teachers, assistant profs, daycare workers, welders etc. you guys do everything! How should I respond to this? Do you have any tips on what to say to the head of the nursing department? Let's say she suggests I do not apply, should I still apply and keep pushing? Should I be looking at entirely different careers? I would really value some opinions on this, it never occurred to me that I may not get into SCHOOL because of my hearing. I'm prepared for employers to maybe be wary, but not a post secondary school that I'd be paying thousands for. What do you think? \n",

      "Writing scifi, seeking feedback In my rather weird SF novel, I've just written most of the first draft of the scene that introduces a character who uses sign, and who will later be introducing my protagonist to non-verbal members of her group. If I may ask, do you have any advice on how to improve this section? Or particular details with which I could fill in the empty spot I marked with square brackets and a question mark?Thank you for your time.-----8<-----... fortunately, this particular drain on my mental resources only lasted until noon, at which time I was hauled off to René's, so I could be bedazzled in time for the ball.On one side of me, Nia was receiving her own outfit, rather more traditional in form; on the other was a figure which was rather less humanoid than I'd interacted with in a while - humanoid from the waist up, arachnid from the cephalothorax back, and whose entire surface was matte black interrupted with various cyan lines and patches. René's plush assistants seemed to be spending their time finding ways to drape fabrics over her many legs, while she leaned her torso against a padded piece of furniture that I didn't think had an equivalent for bipeds, sipped a drink through a straw, and, as best as I could interpret her expression, looked bored.Instead of an ordinary mask, she appeared to be wearing something closer to a helmet, with a translucent visor that blurred her eyes without completely hiding them. Given how carefully the plushie assistants were gluing the sparkly-things to my fur, it looked like we were going to be neighbours for a while, so I nodded a polite greeting and said, \"Hello.\"Nia said something I didn't quite catch, but when I looked at her just shook her head; as I turned back to the spider-taur I saw her hands finishing up some complicated motion. \"Oh,\" I grunted, \"um, I'm sorry - I don't understand any sign languages.\"After a long pause, the new woman said aloud, \"Few here do. Fewer apologize. My name is Agnes Parker - most speakers call me Aggie.\"\"Shoy, meeheh Bunny Waldeinsamkeit.\"\"French?\"\"Canadian - oh, you mean... Shniglish. It's a small language, but I keep using it without meaning to. I'm always up to learning a new way to communicate, though - how would you suggest I introduce myself to someone in sign?\"\"Say 'Sorry, I don't understand sign language' slowly and carefully while looking at them so they can lipread.\"English has a number of flaws; one of them is that there's a word for tilting your head forward and back, and another for rotating it around its vertical axis, but there isn't really any language for tilting it to the side. Despite the lack of a word for that, I tilted my head that way with a smile, if a somewhat asymmetrical one. \"I suppose that's the minimum that can be expected out of me. And if I want to go beyond that minimum?\"Aggie gave me a once-over; then glanced at the plushies entangling her legs in various decorative ways; then shrugged a little. \"'Hello' is this,\" and she held her hand to her forehead in something like a salute. \"And 'My name is' is this,\" and demonstrated another pair of signs.I imitated her, ignoring the sparkle-appliers. \"I'm guessing I don't finish that by saying my name out loud?\"\"That would be rude, yes. I suggest you fingerspell your spoken name. Probably just the first one - I don't know how many letters are in your last name, but forcing someone to wait through all of that wouldn't be polite. Bunny is B, U, N, N, Y.\" She set her right hand into a particular shape for each letter - palm out and all five fingers up; then folding down all but two fingers; folding them all down into a loose fist, then shifting her hand slightly in the same position; then holding out her thumb and pinky.\"Um... you're not hazing me with that, right?\"\"What?\" She spread her hands, palms up.\"That's actually how to spell Bunny, and you're not doing something to have me make fun of myself?\" I imitated some of her gestures, \"with the bunny hopping, and then bunny ears?\"\"You're not from around here, are you?\" As she talked, she continued signing, though I didn't know enough about any sign languages to be able to tell if she was saying the same thing in multiple modes, or if she was emphasizing certain aspects of what she said in sign, or if she was taking the time to insult my ancestry in disparaging terms. She seemed friendly enough that I doubted it was the latter.\"Got into town yesterday, probably heading out again in five or six days. Might be back after that, depending on all sorts of factors.\"\"What do you do?\"\"As long as I have the resources and equipment to? Archaeology, focusing on November of twenty-fifty. Yourself?\"\"Most often these days, translation and interpretation between my people and the general society of this city.\"\"If it's not impolite to ask, what do you mean by 'your people'?\"\"We call ourselves the 'people of the eye', though you're more likely to hear... less complimentary terms.\" Nia muttered something I wasn't able to turn my ear towards her fast enough to catch. \"Most often, the 'Hive'. All of us share an origin, and you can recognize our membership by our colour scheme,\" she waved at herself, \"if nothing else.\"\"I'm always interested in learning more about how the world works,\" I smiled, \"and what's possible in it. What's your shared origin?\"Nia interrupted, \"I have some contacts in the university who specialize in zone studies, and who owe me some favours. Why don't I send a message to invite one or two over here?\"\"I've heard worse plans,\" I admitted, \"though maybe it would be better to meet them in a day or two, so I can really spend some time with them, and they can have all their resources handy for presenting whatever they're studying.\"\"That makes sense,\" Nia agreed, though she didn't look happy. \"René? May I have a word?\"While she and the faux-French proprietor gabbed, I turned back to Aggie, whose eyes widened for a moment before she smiled. \"Now, where were we? Oh, that reminds me - can you recommend any books on your sign language?\"\"It's mostly American Sign Language - we've had to teach it to ourselves, and that's the sign language we found the most books on.\"\"'Had to'?\"\"Not all of us kept as much of our human shape as I did, when we became part of the group. Not all of us can hear or speak - but we can all see, and we all have some part of our body we can move. We've had to invent a few variations of ASL, for members who don't have human-like arms or hands, but it's all derived from the same root, and we try to apply consistent sets of transformations to minimize how much study is required. I have a few notebooks in my panniers, if you're really interested.\"\"I'd like-\"I was interrupted by René leaving Nia to approach Aggie. \"Madame,\" he said, \"I have had the most wonderful idea for a new outfit for you - it will be more work, but if I bring in my part-timers, I can still have you ready in time. But we will need to hurry! And I will need to move you to a private fitting room.\"Aggie looked uncertain. \"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm already stretching my budget thin-\"\"Pish-posh,\" René dismissed her. \"What is the point of attending a ball if you don't draw attention? I will sign my name - when the other ball-goers see what worlds I make of you and come to me, I will just charge them even more.\"\"Well,\" Aggie said, \"I /am/ supposed to make the best impression I can.\"She looked at me apologetically, and I just smiled at her and said, \"It sounds like we're going to the same function, so we can continue this if we can find each other there.\"She nodded, stood, and I watched her multi-limbed gait curiously as she was led deeper into René's shop.I excused myself from my own fitting, claiming Streams was jumping on my bladder, and wasn't lying; but had another purpose in mind. In the privacy of the stall, I whispered to my AI, Boomer, in my marsupial pouch, \"Any chance you already know sign language?\"She answered, \"To comply with various university regulations about the physiodiverse, I am fluent in several dialects of American Sign Language and Quebec Sign Language. However, in my current location, I have neither sensors nor effectors to see or sign.\"\"My prosthetic arms have microphones, so they can hear what I tell them to do - could you use your speaker to interface with them, without it being obvious to anyone nearby?\"\"With a small number of initial commands, that is possible. What will you wish to be signed?\"\"Anything I say to one of these 'people of the eye'. If sign's what they understand best, it's best I do what I can to accommodate them.\"\"While within your pouch, I have no way of recognizing when members of that group are nearby.\"\"We've got that flexible camera and cable I mounted inside the Hopper armour for you - I can probably get just the tip of it poking out of the pouch, and have René hide it in a cluster of sequins. Now, how many ways can you communicate to me what signs you see someone making? Should we stick to Morse code, or do you think these bunny ears of mine can pick up you whispering?\"\"My reference materials on sign language indicate that I should now inform you that there are certain aspects of signed grammar which make live translation difficult, in either direction. For example, [?].\"\"So I'll be a clumsy beginner instead of a fluent speaker - I mean, signer. Better to be an enthusiastic beginner than an uncaring idiot.\"With Munchkin parked just outside, it was easy to make another excuse to duck in for a moment, and then to talk René into adjusting the pattern of sparklies he was laying across my fur for my purpose. At this point, I was barely bothering to think of /why/ I was being discreet about Boomer, my robotic prosthetics, or any of the other little details I was keeping private; the mere fact that I /could/ keep something to myself was just about all the justification I needed to /try/ to keep it secret.But while I kept the hows to myself, I was still willing to show off certain magic tricks. So, once I was all decked out to René's satisfaction, and with his acknowledgement that Aggie wasn't in a compromising state at the moment, I ducked into her room just before I left the salon, to sign a quick 'goodbye and see you soon' to her.Her befuddled expression, and a sign that Boomer relayed as meaning 'what?' at my instant fluency, was going to keep me cheerful through at least the first parts of the ball. I said, and had my arm-bots sign, \"I'd still like to see your notes on transposing signs to non-human limbs, when we get a chance.\"She said, and signed, \"I'll collect my main references and get back to you.\"\"See you at the ball,\" I returned, and went on my way.----->8----- \n",

      "Beautiful PJM Girl in Poland, thank you Sitting at my favorite cheap restaurant in Krakow, I wait for my food to arrive. It's 6 and the sun has begun to set; I'm in a courtyard where all of the tables are taken by couples and groups of friends. I am here by myself today. Next to my table is a guy and a girl, conversing happily in sign language. Naturally their chat is silent, augmented with the occasional laugh, or the sound of one of them clapping their hands together in amusement to a story. They are vibrantly telling stories and I am mesmerized; witnessing a silent conversion is new to me. I also have a hard time taking my eyes off the blonde girl. She has a beautiful smile and looks like she is having an absolutely wonderful evening, as if they are old friends who finally had a chance to meet. I sit there a while, wishing to know not what they talked about but what it is like to communicate in this magical and foreign way. As my curiosity grows, I am humbled... I am just another man who takes the ability to hear for granted. As I eat my dinner, the girl and I occasionally meet eyes. I decide to leave after finishing my meal, but change my mind and go back to my original seat after a cigarette, wishing I could just tell her that she is beautiful. A few moments later the guy with her leaves for the restroom, and I walk over and sit in front of her as politely as I could. I show her my phone, in Google translate, \"I don't speak Polish, but I just want to say\" and I signed in Polish sign language \"you\" and \"beautiful\", which I had quickly memorized a few minutes prior. She understood immediately, smiled brilliantly and gestured thanks, with the same amazing smile she shared with her friend. I stood up and walked back to my table, embarrassed but happy that I could tell her this in her language. I was warmed by the bright smile she kept for the next few minutes as she sat by herself looking at her phone. I'm grateful she let me step into her world for just one moment. I don't know what it's like, but everything about her, her friend, and their conversation - it was beautiful to me. Thank you, beautiful girl in Krakow. I hope you have a wonderful life. I think you will.  \n",

      "Screen-reader Accessible Gaming News Roundup Number 3 Yes, it's another round-up!  I was hoping to do this last week, or even the week before, but life got busy.  In compensation, this one is extra large.  Unfortunately, I have to open with some extremely sad news.  Popular audio game developer Jim Kitchen has [past away](  His accessible games for DOS were some of the first computer games I ever played, and I'm sure a lot of other blind people can say the same thing.  Over the last 20 years, first on DOS and then on Windows, Jim Kitchen released some of the highest quality and most consistently fun screen-reader accessible games available.  Not only that, he always released them as freeware.  Though he was only 58 at the time of his passing, he leaves behind a legacy that will be remembered and enjoyed by our community for many, many years.  While I'm talking about glories past, I guess this is as good a time as any to mention that the [zesarux]( ZX Spectrum emulator is now screen-reader accessible.  So if you have fond memories of playing old ZX Spectrum games, you can now play them with your screen-reader on Mac or Windows.  More information about the ZX Spectrum, and how to get this working is [available in this audio review](  Of course if you're like me, your first ever memories of using a computer were of an Apple II.  If that's the case, [messapple]( is the accessible emulator for you.  What would a mega round-up post be without a MUD of some kind?  Thankfully, we don't have to find out.  In [a promotional post]( /u/omegared85 made to /r/MUD, s/he mentiones that the Cybersphere MOO is accessible with screen-readers.  I don't play there myself, so YMMV.  But it is a text-based game, so as long as you have an accessible MUD client, you should be fine.  If you play CyberSphere, please let us know how well it goes in the comments!  From MUDs to choose your own adventures: have you ever wanted an easy way to create a choose your own adventure book?  If so, you'll be interested in [this post]( from /u/rudism to /r/interactivefiction.  It's about a new system he created called [ficdown]( that allows you to write choice-based interactive fiction using Markdown.  Seeing as Reddit already uses Markdown to format posts and comments, if you know Reddit, you know almost everything you need to use Ficdown.  The ficdown program itself runs on the command-line, so creating CYOAs is completely accessible, and it can output standard HTML files, so playing adventures made with Ficdown is also completely accessible.  Next up, mainstream gaming!  [This Let's Play]( demos co-operative play between a group of sighted players and a blind friend in the game Project Reality, made possible by the game's support for 3d audio.  Thanks to /u/TheBelgianStrangler for [this post]( to /r/gaming.  Do you have a Braille display?  If so, you might be able to play [this Braille adaptation]( of the game Flappy Bird.  Unfortunately, I don't, so I really can't say anything about it.  Does this work for you, or is it a complete failure?  Let us know in the comments, Braille users!  It feels like this post now has every variety of accessible game, accept for audio games!  Luckily, Oriol Gomez is here to save us, with the release of the new free Windows audio game [copter mission](  From the website:> America is at war, and you are in command of a helicopter.

The website, [ covers news about accessible games, and posts game reviews of mainstream titles, rating them based on how accessible they are to various groups of people.  If you're interested in more popular gaming titles, this site is worth a bookmark.  Woo!  That was a pile of links.

      "Questions from a sighted person I don't know any blind people or much about their lives, so sorry in advance if my language is ignorant. Please let me know what the right stuff to say is.  I have been thinking a lot about blindness and sight recently because I've been having trouble with my eyes. I tend to worry about small things, so maybe it's nothing serious, but the thought of losing my sight scares me.  If I went blind, I think the things I would miss the most would be video games, driving, and talking with my deaf friends. How to blind people play video games? How do blind people get around? How do blind people communicate with the deaf?  If a person starts to lose sight or loses sight very suddenly, what are some things they should do right away? What makes adjusting to life without sight easier?  I have never tried to learn to read or type braille. Are braille typewriters still a thing? How difficult and how long does it take for a newbie to learn braille? How useful is it to you? Can you use a \"sighted\" computer keyboard with ease?  How does walking with a cane or stick help and does it work for everyone? What kinds of things can guide dogs help with and are there cons or tradeoffs that sighted people might not know about? My roommates have dogs. Do guide dogs get along well with other dogs? Do they need to play with other dogs to be happy? Can they stay focused or be released to play on command?  I'm a university student studying computer science. How do blind people read and write code efficiently? How do blind students take tests? Are there any blind programmers or computer scientists here? What kind of work do you do and how is your work different from that of your sighted peers?  Thanks for your responses.  Edit: I have a million more questions. I know it's a lot. Just answer as little or as much as you care, I guess. I'm not the boss!  Do you shop with a friend to find clothes, food, etc.? Do stores usually have an employee help if you ask them? Does it bother you when stores change their layouts? How do you write a check and keep track of cash (ie the difference between a $1 note and a $20 note)? How do you enter a credit card number into paypal or amazon?  How do you take prescription medication? I take several different ones at different times of the day. I use a pill organizer that happens to have braille on it, but how would a blind person fill it? Especially if one doesn't read braille.  Can you recognize all your friends and family by their voices alone? Do you get confused by friends that sound similar or who you don't know well? Is it harder to tell who people are over the phone (if you don't know their number)?  Do restaurants have audio or braille menus? Sometimes I eat alone. Are servers known to have the patience to read a menu to a blind customer?  Do you feel safe drinking alcohol? With the way alcohol impairs the senses, I guess if I was blind, I would be hesitant to drink, already having one less than I'm used to. Is it true that use of hallucinogens can cause blind people to see things? Does it compare to normal sight, or is it more like non-sensical information?  What things are less important to blind people? I imagine blind people caring a little less about fashion, TV, and movies. I know there are audio guides that describe TV and movies, but how good are they and do you find them useful or adequate? Where is modern technology lacking in helping blind people?  How do you remember all the things sighted people are used to writing down? Grocery lists, homework due dates or work deadlines, reminders, addresses?  Thank you all so much. \n",

      "Any advice for the parent of a Deaf/HOH child for long-term success/happiness? I'm sorry if this isn't the best place to ask but I was hoping it was a good place to start. My son is 2.5 yrs old and has bilateral SNHL. We (my SO and I) are still testing and gathering info but at his last check, he's at about 50db. He's had hearing aids for about 5 months now and he's in a great Day School program through our local school district for a couple hours a day. We love his program and even though we have a Deaf School in our city, we have chose his current program because although it prioritizes spoken language, the ToD in charge has been very supportive of our choice to teach and use ASL as well. The local Deaf school is pretty much ASL only. After months of testing and doctors, our sons obvious joy at going to and being in his class has been a welcome and much needed relief. He even loves getting on the bus each morning! As happy as we are with his progress, we find ourselves looking ahead with no real road-map and fluctuating versions of expectations. Our son is the only family member under 50yo with hearing loss and our little family and my parents are the only ones who sign so we are having a hard time planning what is needed for this part of his life. We are trying hard to understand what he's going through and how he experiences the world but it's been a bit of a unique challenge. We've been reaching out to the Deaf community through his school, trying to make local ASL events, and I've started an ASL playgroup that will meet for the first time later this month. I'm also part of several social media groups geared towards parents of Deaf/HOH kids, although there are usually very few Deaf adults in those groups. Going forward, we're just not sure what to expect or, more importantly, what to plan for. Are there any recommendations you can give for new parents on particular things we should plan for? Things you would recommend or not recommend doing? Anything you wish your parents had done for you, outside of what every kid wants? Thank you in advance of any input you can give! EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who has given their two cents so far! My basic take-away so far has been: 1. ASL always. Not SEE, not sim com, etc. Fluency is a must. 2. Don't force speech. 3. Reach out and maintain contact with the Deaf community. 4. Give him the chance to communicate effectively and independently. 5. Teach him to be his own advocate. Advocate for personal agency. 6. Make and regularly evaluate both short and long-term goals. 7. Be aware that I won't always be able to understand what he's going through and although that will be rough, its expected. Keep trying anyway. 8. Keep our expectations high (but realistic) and know that if we work as hard as we expect him to, we have the best chance of helping him find a life in which he feels he is happy and successful. If there's anything to add to the list, feel free to let me know. Again, thank you everyone for your responses. It really helps to hear from Deaf adults. :)  \n",

      "Feedback needed: Videogame YouTube show for visually impaired, blind and otherwise disadvantaged people Disclaimer: I am not visually impaired myself, but have been locally very active in various NGOs and communities aiming to improve the quality of life of autistic people. I have always been a very avid gamer myself and have worked in videogames for a large part of my professional career. Last year I started a YouTube channel, where I record myself playing games - so called Let's Plays. Nothing very important, just playing around. This year, I want my time spent on gaming videos to be more meaningful. As a video game developer, I saw how much Apple is doing on their platforms and devices to maximize the accessibility. I had a chance to learn how people with various impairments and disabilities are able to use an iPad or a computer via the extended accessibility features. Watching a completely blind person flawlessly prepare a presentation from her photos on the device, adding a commentary and creating a short video was really humbling, but also inspiring. Similarly, I was able to see how heavily physically disadvantaged girl, tied to a wheelchair and only able to move her head slightly was playing angry birds. I realized that I want to look for more ways people can enjoy games, despite the challenges they might be facing. Early this year, I was curious about how visually impaired people game. I found a number of great videos online, where people play Mario Kart or Abe's Oddysey and though how great that was. And then I realized there are many great games, game experiences and stories a lot of people may never experience, even if they would genuinely enjoy them. So I decided to start a series called Blind Gaming, which might be a bit narrow for what it should stand for - inclusive gaming or gaming for everyone. And while I am in love with the idea, there may be a ton of things I am missing. What would really help me would be your feedback. Here is a link to my first YouTube video in this series, I would love to hear what you think, if this is helpful or what we could do with my colleague, to make this more helpful to this specific reddit and community. I promise to read all feedback and think on it. Thank you to everybody who is willing to help me make the series better for everybody. [The video link]( I want to commit to making a commented captioned videogame gameplay videos, making enjoyment of games as accessible as possible to everybody. Please, let me know your feedback.  \n",

      "CI process update and a BIG THANK YOU! Hey guys, I just wanted to update, a bit has happened from my last [post]( I've been deaf in my left ear since I was a baby, and hard of hearing in my right ear where I wear a hearing aid. I'm 18 years old, done high school, and my hearing is declining. My speech is and always has been fantastic! I speak English and French, lip read, but I don't know any sign language. I'm in the process of getting a cochlear implant, and I'm blessed enough to live in a place where two CI's and their surgeries are 100% covered by the government.A couple weeks ago I had a balance test done, where they shoot water in my ears and a machine tracks my eye movements or something. I got SUPER dizzy when they put water in my left ear, but no reaction in my right ear (they tried twice). I was told by the person who did this procedure that this wasn't something to be super duper concerned about, it just meant that pretty much all my balance is reliant on my left side. Okay cool.She sends the results to my main audiologist for this process, the one who recommends I get the surgery in my right ear, and that audiologist e-mails my mom, telling mom that if I get a CI in my left ear, it could mess up my balance AKA I am now at a higher risk for balance issues.So all the people involved have a big meeting about my case with my amazing (I cannot explain how amazing) ENT/surgeon. I have a great history with him, I really appreciate and respect him because he sees things from his patients perspective, not just a rigid professional standpoint. This morning I had an appointment for a little chat with him, and it went really well! Before I could even state my case on why I should get my left ear first, he was like \"hold up, let me tell you why you should get your left ear done!\" We were in fantastic mutual agreement, he agreed that I am young, I have time to get my right ear done in the future, that we should exhaust all options before destroying the little (and precious) hearing that I do have in my right. He took the words out of my mouth when he said that the risk of a balance issue probably outweighs the potential to really benefit from a CI/hear again. He said that you truly NEVER know. If you look over my files, I should not be speaking and functioning at the great level that I always have been, my papers do not reflect how my life is; and this could be the case for my left ear's CI too, why not try. On top of that, they are doing their best to get me on the pediatric list! This is amazing because the adult wait list is about 8-12 months long. The pediatric wait list is about 1-3 months long. THAT'S RIGHT, 1-3 MONTHS! Since I am 18 when starting this process, I should still count as pediatric, and they will get me in as soon as they possibly can.But, I want to thank YOU guys! I came on here originally to get a couple opinions, I wasn't expecting too much. But you guys have given me so much support, and so much hope. Whether it was an opinion, a tip, sharing an experience, you all truly lifted my spirit and made me see things in a different way. Of course I know I'm not alone, there are hundreds of people in the world going through any stage of the process at any time, but actually seeing your stories really helped. I know there are a lot of people who oppose CI's on here, and I was a little worried about getting some negative feedback, but I really didn't get anything major. I'm not saying being deaf is bad at all, it's just that in my life, in my experience, a CI (possibly two in the future) is what I want. Whether it was a \"good luck\" or a full story, you all seriously helped me.I don't have any solid appointments coming up. I need to get a meningitis vaccine, and then it's just about waiting for the \"we have a surgery date set\" call. I don't believe I'd have any other updates coming up except for when I actually get the surgery. So my next update is likely a couple months away, but thank you guys again:) \n",

      "Questions about accessibility in a game. Hey, I was telling someone about a text based game I am working on, which is a multi-player survival and adventure game, and they suggested that it would be a great idea to add accessibility features for blind people. I had already planned on including Text-to-Speech and audio buttons for the client. But, I will admit, I know very little about other accessibility needs that the game may need. I will tell you a little about the game, and then maybe you could give me some advice on how I can make it easier for everyone to play?The game originally, was going to be a graphics-based game but it's since pivoted to just wanting to explore text adventures with a modern multiplayer twist. So, I refurbished some MMO code I had previously written, and I am turning it into a purely text based game you can play with friends. However, not just a text adventure, a text adventure in which people can create their own worlds, objects, characters, monsters, and dungeons-- build and write their own adventures and fantasy worlds, share them with friends, play them with friends, all in text. It is similar to the concept of a MUD (MultiUser Dungeon) if you have ever played one, but on a much larger and more intricate scale. A universe of text. While I will be hosting and running my own (hopefully) growing world-- a single shard server will be available for free for others to download build their own text-based worlds to play in, privately, with family and friends-- no costs. I'm not building the game to make money, I'm building it because I want to build a game I can love, and a game I can be proud of building. The client of the game will consist of a terminal window for incoming text, a typing box, and some UI buttons. For creating your own worlds, the client UI, optionally, becomes a little more expansive with input fields for planets, tiles, room names, descriptions, objects, and all the object stats, etc. Same with NPCs.So, I have some questions. As I'm building the text terminal for the game and the UI for world creation and editing, what can I do ahead of time to ensure good accessibility is there for people who may want to play? 1. What would help you navigate the client? 2. Is there specialized software I could have the client interact with?3. What kind of a game play action pace should there be? As there can be combat between players and NPCs. What can I do in the cases where there's a lengthy room description (usually under 512 characters though), but also a potentially aggressive monster in the same room that might attack before you've been able to hear the room/monster description? The plan was already to keep combat slow paced, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this one. Do you have suggestions? 4. When there is combat in the game, it will work in rounds. Each combat round will consist of two phases, a preperation phase and then a combat phase. In the preperation phase you will have an amount of time to wield weapons, use equipment, play with inventory, cast spells, and do things adventurers may do depending on your action points. Once the time is over on the preperation phase, the combat round begins, which is automatic, and your actions will play out, then the next round prepares until you are victorious or defeated. What do you think of this choice for combat? Does it work for you? Do you have a suggestion on how fast or slow these rounds should be in terms of time?5. My last question is, while any kind of multiplayer text adventure can be created through the editor, the core framework is focused on survival, crafting, base building, and exploring dungeons and points of interest. What would you like to be able to do in this kind of world? What game features would you like to experience?I came in with a simple question and prattled on a bit, but I hope you don't mind giving me some guidance and advice. If you have additional questions, I'll be happy to answer them.Thanks ahead of time! \n",

      "Deafness preventing you from keeping a job? If you're interested in self-employment, I can help. *I asked the mods for permission to post this, and they said okay. This is a slightly modified post I made on /r/CRD last night.*Hey guys,I suffer from a serious sleep disorder, and while studying ASL online with Bill Vicars a few months ago, I came across a Deaf forum. I noticed very similar employment issues with Deaf people and people who suffer from circadian rhythm disorders—most of society just isn't designed for us. So...I've come up with an idea that's totally experimental, and I'm looking for 8-12 test subjects. (It's... definitely not as ominous as that sounds.)Here's the ideal candidate:* Un- or underemployed because of a \"societal disability\" like a CRD or Deafness* Willing to put in 5 to 10 hours of work per week* Able to write with proper grammar and punctuation* Has regular internet access for email and research* Open to (optional) phone coaching if our schedules line up *[Other than a couple episodes of Switched at Birth, I've no idea how phone conversations work in the Deaf community, but I'm willing to figure it out if it'll help you.]*The cost for this service is **absolutely FREE**. I really want to test this idea with a larger sample size than just myself, so here's what support you'll get from me:* As much email consulting as you need to find a profitable business idea using skills you already have* As much email support as you need until you find at least 3 paying clients* Free 30 minute consulting/coaching calls up to once a week to help hone your strategy and tactics until you've found your first 3 clients. *[Only if you find phone conversations more helpful than email.]*Again, *this may not work*, but I'd really like to see if I can help out a few communities that have a harder time than necessary finding gainful employment.So, to reiterate: **I'm looking for 8-12 un- or underemployed participants, either Deaf or suffering from circadian rhythm disorders, who would be interested in pursuing self-employment—with no startup costs and using skills you already have.**Again, I have nothing to sell, this opportunity is offered at no charge, and your participation would greatly help me determine how easily this can be done, and how I can develop strategies to help others over these employment difficulties.Anyone who's interested, please comment below with any questions you have—or send me a PM if you'd just like to get started immediately.(P.S. If you know any Deaf people or CRD sufferers who might benefit, feel free to pass this along.)**EDIT:** I just realized a major objection I left out last night: *What if I don't have a resume or any meaningful work experience?* Don't worry about that. My resume is a blank sheet of paper, and I've never held a real job longer than three days. I know exactly what you're dealing with, and the harder you think your challenge is, the more fun it'll be for us to solve. \n",

      "Introduction and Counseling a camp for Deaf/HoH high schoolers Hello! I'm a long time stalker of reddit and I've finally decided to make an account because I have fallen in love with this subreddit. My brief background is that I was diagnosed with hearing loss when I was about 7. I'm now in college. My hearing was better at that initial diagnosis than it is now, but it hasn't moved much since hitting its lowest point around 8 years old. My loss is severe profound in the right and deaf in the left. My left ear gets absolutely no sound input. Thus, I have worn a strong BTE on my right since then. Also, excitingly, I just had surgery done yesterday for a cochlear implant on my left! I have had a ton of emotions about the experience. However, it was not that I feared the procedure, but I struggled to to think of how my identity would doubtless change as a CI wearer. I was afraid of being less welcomed by the deaf community, which I respect and love, and that being able to hear out of both ears would cause people to have unreasonable expectations about my ability to communicate. I do know a good bit of ASL and am comfortable about using it. I was mainstreamed my whole life, a decision my parents let me make, so I'm only really ever around hearing people. I did not have any friends with hearing loss growing up, which as many of you know, makes things a challenge socially. Currently, I attend college and study speech and hearing science with the intent of studying audiology in grad school next year. It's funny though, not even most of the people in my major are very tolerant or understanding of my hearing loss. Granted, most are there to be speech language pathologists, and about 97% of them are girls, I am a dude. It's like nobody wants to take their work home with them :') lmao. Anyway, I am extremely passionate about advocating hearing loss and deaf awareness. This passion has led to my becoming a counselor at a camp this summer for teens with hearing loss in high school. The aim is to help prepare them for the transition to college. There's a lot to discuss and I know many people who never had an opportunity like this, which makes it thrilling for both counselors and campers alike! This will be the second year I've done this and I'm incredibly excited to do so! However, one thing about last year that made me sad was that of all the people in attendance, I felt like I was doing the worst at following what was going on. With my degree of hearing loss, this isn't too surprising. But I admittedly felt about the same as I do when I'm in a noisy place with hearing people. As you may imagine, a room full of people who cannot hear well is the opposite of quiet; because everyone is yelling! Lastly, I'm looking for some thoughts on what all to say to the kids. We cover everything from social situations to time management and academic integrity. So, even if you feel like you are going to mention something that is very likely covered by the camp already, please please go ahead! If there is anything I have learned it is that everyone has a different perspective to share. I love discussing this stuff! TLDR: I am a deaf/HoH male in college who is going to be a counselor at a camp for Deaf/HoH teens to help them transition to college. I seek opinions on the matter as I am always looking for ways to improve the experience of the kids! \n",

      "[App Review] Meditation timer app for Windows Phone that buzzes when finished. Hi everyone, I'm a big fan of meditation (I try to meditate every day) and just thought I would post this review in case it helps anyone.  I have tried a number of different meditation timers on my Windows Phone (Nokia Lumia 920) but my favorite so far is called Serenity Meditation Timer (link below).There are a lot of great meditation timers available for Windows phone, but there are a few key features that I like about this one:* The phone buzzes after the timer is finished.* Starting the timer is faster and easier than the other timers I have found.  You don't have to scroll through a number wheel to get to 20 minutes ever time, for example, you just tap the \"20 minutes\" button and then the start button.* The app includes a getting started guide for beginners.  I loved this aspect because it tells you how to start meditating the right way and includes pointers for those that have been meditating for a while too.* A dozen different chime sounds, all in high-definition audio.  The sound of the chime I used during meditation is very important to me and I like the variety of the chimes available with this app and that the audio of each is so crisp and clear.  For me, this aspect is very satisfying after I finish my meditation.  I'm in a state of happiness and the crisp and clear audio allows for a nice finish.* History section.  The app has a history section so that I can track my progress.  It sums up my meditation time for the last day, week, month, year, and all time.  It also includes a history of each individual meditation event's date and time.Anyway, I hope this helps someone.  Meditation has changed my life for the better and I recommend it to anyone for reducing stress, anxiety, fear, and generally improving one's life and one's relationships with others.---Serenity Meditation Timer \n",

      "New hearing aid for the first time in ~8 years, nervous and excited about it! Hi there. I just want to share my story here, because I have taken quite a big leap recently and decided to give hearing aids another try after several years without them. I am profoundly deaf. Left ear is a goner, my right ear has around 90db loss in the lower-mid level frequencies. I have some hearing in the higher frequencies though. I lost my hearing at a very young age, and spent most of my school years wearing a hearing aid.When I was in secondary school, I became a little more conscious of how I \"looked\" wearing a hearing aid, and realised that it didn't help me as much as I thought it did (this was during the digital aids introduction). I made a decision to stop wearing it (terrible idea in hindsight) and to focus on lipreading and coping as best I could. I haven't done badly in that regard, completing school, university, getting a great job and a fantastic wife. Sometimes I don't really realise the extent of my hearing loss, I just \"get on with it\" so to speak. I automatically position myself so I can see, hear and lipread people. I use captions for films and at the cinema. I have even printed transcripts for stage shows. I can't hear on the telephone - no problem, SMS, Whatsapp etc. During this period (at the age of around 18) I also tried out digital hearing aids again and I couldn't stand them. It was \"too much\" for me, and what I was hearing through the aids challenged my idea of \"normal\". In hindsight I was extremely stubborn and unwilling to give them a try - but I just couldn't deal with how different they sounded. The way I always described it was everything sounding a bit like \"shhh shhh\" and electronic/unnatural. After speaking with my audiologist yesterday I realise that I was overwhelmed by the new sounds and the \"shhshh\" was a lot of the bassy sounds. Fast forward 5 years to now (age 23) and I have decided to give hearing aids another try. I am convinced that they WILL make a difference to my life if I take the time to get used to them. I'm a scientific person, so if I know that the science behind them is good (it is), I know that any difficulty or lack of acceptance is my own fault. I am a little more open minded (and I think society is too) to wearing them. Most people are shocked when I tell them that I don't wear hearing aids. Anyway, I went to see an audiologist yesterday. I went for a hearing test and it was pretty much exactly what I expected. Nothing in the left ear, profound loss in the right. He told me a bit about the developments in hearing aid technology and proceeded to let me try a new one that was suited (although not calibrated) to my degree of hearing loss. He set the power to 70% rather than 100% because he said that I would not be able to handle it (instead, we would work up to it), and WOW. Everything sounded different. The first thing I noticed was that there was so much bass and the lower frequencies sounds that I had never heard before suddenly came alive. I could hear myself a bit better too. We went for a walk outside (through a mall, then into a very busy city area) and I was hearing lots of new sounds. The mall we were in had ambient music. I didn't know that car and bus engines sounded DIFFERENT, nor that they were so loud! Normally I only hear engines when the car speeds up, not when they are idle. I kept picking up lots of other sounds as well, but the difficulty I had was identifying them. I had to keep asking my wife and the audiologist what the sounds were. I guess I am going to have to re-learn (my wife says like a baby...) what everything sounds like. And the best thing? Despite all this loud background noise, I could hear my wife and the audiologist perfectly. I guess that is the wonder of modern hearing aids. Sure, it's different, but I need to remember that what I hear right now (without aids) is not the full range of what I should be hearing, so it will obviously sound different. I want to grab 18 year old me and tell him this! We talked a bit more with the audiologist and decided to opt for the Solana UP ITE hearing aid. It matches my hearing loss profile, it is discreet and we are all convinced that it will make a big difference to my life once I get used to it. I'm quite excited about this (I have to wait 2 weeks for it to be made) but also nervous and scared about the breaking in period. Thankfully because I am still youngish, my audiologist says that I will adapt quickly. I hope so!If you have any advice or tips for me during this period, I'd really appreciate them! I will try and post a follow up as I get used to them. Also, I know this might be a bit early, but are there any accessories worth looking into? I had a look at the Phonak Smartlink+ and it sounds like a very useful thing to have. It seems like it will function as a microphone for people (my wife, colleagues in a meeting) and help me pick up more specific sounds in noisy environments (as well as to pick up sounds from 360' in quieter environments like classrooms or meetings. One more thing, and this may be a dumb question but when flying, do I need to take my hearing aid out for the security check? Do I need to take them out during the flight? Thanks!! \n",

      "Looking for assistance with alarm clocks! I am currently working with a group of researchers and developers at Purdue University, trying to design a better alarm clock for the deaf/HoH community! We are familiar with current solutions on the market but would love to hear more about the problems they cause first hand.  As it stands, we are looking to create a wearable patch that can be placed on the person wherever most comfortable to the user. We also like the idea of creating a gentle wake feature using small vibrations to slowly wake the user. The patch would be made from a soft, sticky silicone rubber, reusable and easy to clean. Controlled via app, the user could set alarms, check the status of the device, and control how strong the vibration would be. We want to create a simple, cheaper, more effective solution that will effectively wake only the user wearing it.We would really love to hear your thoughts on our idea, and feedback about what features/directions we should work on! I’ve included a survey below with some more questions as well if you feel so inclined!We really appreciate your time and feedback![ \n",

      "What are your experiences as a Deaf/HoH student in a hearing British secondary school? Hiya, although I understand this is quite a broad question, I am curious as to the different experiences Deaf/HoH students have had in hearing British secondary schools. Every experience is different, so I've tried to narrow it down with some more specific questions, but if you would prefer to ignore them and freestyle it please absolutely go for that too!! I am particularly interested in the frequency and quality of interpreters, as I personally have never heard of one being provided in a British school, and with family members in education, I know that a resource like that would be incredibly hard to budget due to the expense (this isn't to say that interpreters shouldn't be provided btw, just that I know that they are expensive). I am also interested in as to how a Deaf/HoH student would be able to follow along as the teacher speaks. I understand that there are so many wonderful speech-to-text apps out there, but I can imagine that they would quite quickly fall behind in the fast-paced environment of a classroom, and in lessons with more specialised words (such as Science or History) the apps may not know the words and grossly mishear.&#x200B;**Support in relation to disability*** Overall, would you say you feel positive/negative/inbetween about the support you were given in relation to your disability?* What support were you given automatically by the school? (eg an interpreter, a communication device, speech therapy)* What support did you have to request from the school? Which requests were fulfilled, if any?**Emotional wellbeing in relation to disability*** Overall, would you say that your school supported your emotional wellbeing in relation to your disability (eg if you were experiencing bullying in relation to your disability, do you feel that the school supported you/dealt with it accordingly?)* What did your school do in order to support socialisation with hearing children? (eg set up a signing club, provide a communication device, buddy you up with a CODA or a certain child)* Did you feel included, both in a classroom environment and in the playground?&#x200B;If you would like to share your experience in the comments below or share links to others' experiences posted elsewhere, I would really appreciate it! I am so sorry if I said anything offensive, I know very little about the community and would love to know more, so please correct me if needs be. Thank you so so much for sharing!! \n",

      "I decorated my white cane for the season. So I decorated my white cane this season to look like a candy cane.  I know I’m a bit late in the season, but I finally was able to get this done because I wanted to wait for a specific somebody to help me with it.  It wasn’t until last night that we were able to sit down and get this done because of our schedules and because of one of us getting sick.   Overall, it took about 45 minutes but I do have a lot of experience with automotive vinyl wrap, But then again I’m blind, and I was guiding somebody that has zero experience with it.Are used automotive vinyl wrap because of its quality it’s durability its ability to protect my cane and its price Plus the selections of colors is phenomenal.  I went with a satin pearlescent white for the base and a satin red for the candycane stripes.  I have the no Jabba cane and the bottom of it is red so I wanted to cover that with white to make the whole Kane white and I decided to do the whole Kane except for the very top or the no job press is in word so it could be uniform And that way I can also add protection to the whole Kane.  My Kane has a bit of nicks and scuff marks from day-to-day use so I wanted to just hope it and cover it in order to just offer more protection, overall.  We wrapped the paper around the Kane three times but in retrospect that was overkill and we should only done it twice since the vinyl wrap itself it’s pretty thick, although it’s just pretty much a sheet of paper.  For the red stripe, we went with a half inch stripe, and we tried to match as closely as we could the angle of the stripe across the whole cane.  We just typed into Google candy canes and looked at the image result, and went with what a majority of them were showing us.  Although I am beyond happy with the results, and I’m told it looks phenomenally good if I were to change anything, I would only wrap the cane twice over and for the red stripes, I would make them thinner to show more of the white cane .Sorry for the pictures, but we finish this up at 2 AM and we didn’t have any good light to show off the Kane but I will post more pictures later on.  The great thing about vinyl wrap is it comes off super easy when you want it to and it leaves no residue or any yucky mess from the adhesive. It comes clean off.  I am definitely looking towards the future and thinking about doing more designs for the coming holidays throughout the year.For those unaware satin is a matte color, but with a small amount of gloss on it, also the pearlescent white that I went with refracts, a small amount of blue and purple, depending on the angle that you’re looking at the Kane.  So, at a glance, it appears mostly white, but at certain angles, there’s a hint of blue and purple in it.  I also went with a deep satin red to help accent the candycane stripes.Last, but not least the price.  I got one sheet of 1‘ x 5‘ of satin per less than white and one sheet of 1‘ x 5‘ satin deep red.    We used about 60% of the weight and close to 10 to 15% of the red so we have plenty left over for other projects if we wanted it to be used on other things or for repairs if needed.  I paid $12.50 per sheet so that’s $25 +6 dollar shipping to ship from California to the East Coast so in total came out to $31.  Since I went with namebrand wrap, I paid a premium for it but you can definitely cut down the price in half if you go for regular no-name brand vinyl wrap,.Here’s a picture that we took last night but then again, sorry for the picture since we didn’t have any good like to take the picture last night. the pictures came through for those of you that can see it or that I have somebody that can describe it to you.  I will be more than happy to answer any questions for anybody that have them. \n",

      "Introductions Hi all.I figured I would introduce myself, or at least get something out there. I imagine I will be posting occasionally on this subredit as things progress, now that I have become invested in redit. Briefly then, my name is Jonathon. I am, to the best of my knowledge, the first or one of the first people to backpack the world independently while also being completely blind. I have been travelling for about a year and a half now, and have covered the majority of North America, including most states in the US, most of the Canadian provinces and portions of both Mexico and South America. As I do so, I am running advocacy projects in each new city I go to. These projects consist primarily of working with local municipal governments and organisations to promote educational reforms that will introduce the skills that I am learning as I travel across the world to blind children. Unfortunately these skills are relatively undocumented, so I am having to pioneer them as I go and find out what does and does not work. For instance, the best ways In which a visually impaired person can safely enter a new and foreign city and become acclimated quickly, or the best and safest ways to navigate highways whilst hitchhiking. There are a variety of these skills that are, unfortunately, lacking in current educational practices, such as with in orientation and mobility or VI lessons. These skills translate not only to backpacking, but also to blind children developing confidence and self-advocacy within their own cities. If I can, I will do my best to allow others to do as I am in the future. I have not yet met or heard of another completely blind person who has done this, particularly in the traditional backpacking sense, that being limited in funding and having to rely upon non-traditional means of travel, such as hitchhiking or walking between cities. Though I am perhaps one of the first, I do not intend to be the last, and think that the capacity for the blind community to be able to travel in this way is valuable and necessary. Two often the disabled feel that they are limited to stay within the geographical areas that they have grown up in, even going so far as to say that they cannot do many things even within their own cities. I intend to change this.Less dramatically, I love travel and find that this is an extremely liberating lifestyle. I'm flying to Europe in the beginning of January, where I will do my best to backpack going east from France. I hope to reach Asia by this time next year. I'm hoping that this community Will find what I'm doing interesting and respond. The more contacts I have and the more people I can get my message out to, the better. This is true in both the blind and sighted world. I would love to talk to anyone who has any questions, or simply discuss methods and skills or anything else of interest. I will be starting podcasts within the next few months, once I have learned how to properly do sound editing on my phone. I had a blog, though lack of readership meant that I let it die. I'll put the link here anyway for those who may be interested to read it. I also recently conducted an interview with a Canadian TV channel which is being broadcast in the beginning of January, and will post that link as well once it becomes available.Lastly, if there is anyone who would like to meet in person, be that for drinks or just a chat, I would love to engage more with both the blind and the backpacking communities. Chances are I will have a chance to go through the cities of most people Who might read this. So, comment or message me. Thanks for reading and I look forward to engaging with this subredit. Crossposted to both the backpacking and blind subredits. Blog link:  \n",

      "Hi! I'm a senior in high school and need your help! Hi, I'm a senior in high school and need your help! I'm currently in an engineering class and we have a year long project to build something that'll solve a problem. The idea my group and I have come up with has to do with helping the deaf. I'm not allowed to give away what our project is but it has to do with deaf people and music. If you have time, I'd like to ask you to fill out a [survey]( It's only a few questions so it shouldn't take too much time to complete. Also, if you have any questions or concerns, don't be shy! I don't mean to offend anyone here and I'm sorry if I do. I'm also sorry if this isn't the right place to be posting something like this and if so, could you guys direct me towards somewhere this is appropriate? Thank you in advance. Edit : Wow! Thanks to all who helped out by answering and special thanks to those who are giving me their two cents! It really means a lot! If I have any questions or need help I'll definitely be coming back here for help. Y'all are so friendly! It's awesome! \n",

      "If the Deaf Ruled the Earth - Need assistance w/ understanding deafness for writing project Hey, so I'm trying to write a book (fantasy fiction) that at its core challenges notions of societal/systematic normalcy. To do this, I want to imagine a world that is exactly our own with key elements changed. One area I'd like to give particular focus is a reimagined world where the deaf are the majority and the hearing the minority; the two populations completely inversed from what they are today. The problem is that as a hearing person I'm falling short of imagining this brave new deaf world. Can anyone help me understand what this world might be like? Feel free to be as specific or vague as you please! Deaf & hearing perspectives are both welcomed! I listed some things below that I hope are helpful for anyone who would like some starting points for imagining this new world:1.)For the deaf: What are the top 5-10 pros & cons to being deaf? What is the one thing you really, really wish hearing people understood?For the hearing: What are the top 5-10 pros & cons to being hearing? Can you remember a time when you really, really wished you could turn your ears off? If so, what was going on then & how would deafness have helped?2.)In this reimagined deaf world, what is different to our senses? Is the world cluttered with more ads and billboards than ever before without the audio landscape taking on that pollution? All the soccer coaches, officers, teachers, etc. who usually wear a whistle around their neck to grab someone’s attention, what do they use now? If everyone is signing, not speaking now, how does that make a busy city street look/feel/sound/smell different? (IE, are there fewer people holding food/drinks because they’re too cumbersome when trying to sign?) How does someone knock on the door in this world? 3.)How does dating/sex change? Does it change at all? Porn’s gotta change a bit, right? Would hearing and/or audible porn become a new fetish? Are there sexy sign language accents like there are sexy spoken accents? If you’re a hearing person who doesn’t like the sound of your own voice (stutter/lisp/too nasally/deep/high-pitched/etc.), how would your life be different if you lived in this deaf world where 95% of the population couldn’t hear or judge your voice? Can you describe what it would be like to realize that not only could your voice not be heard by most, but those who could hear it would also be unlikely to judge it harshly at all as it’s such an uncommon ability in the first place?4.)In this new world, how do we as a society function differently? Are people more, less, or the same level of collaborative? Does a deaf society prove more or less passive or hostile compared to our current world? More or less racist/sexist/classist? How does this new world treat the hearing? Are they distrusted because they have a more acute 5th sense? Are they revered? 5.)What happens to spoken language, does it evolve at all with only 5% of the population able to hear? If spoken language existed, when would this reimagined world/society need to make use of it? (IE, what is its purpose?) Would there be taboos against using spoken language in certain situations?6.)How does the technology change? How would the computer/internet/smartphone evolve if tailored to the deaf and not the hearing? What about television & film?For the hearing: think of everything you use today technology-wise that relies on sound and your ability to hear it, how do you achieve the same functionality in this world? For the deaf: what drives you crazy about current day technology? How could it have been made with you in mind? 7.)How does art change? What is going to fill the gap left when music is not the art form it is today? Could music still be the art form it is today in our reimagined world? If so, how? Could the gap be filled with a new form of art, one not existing today or not to the same capacity, perhaps based around another of the five senses? 8.) In this new world, how do you change as a person? For the deaf: I imagine that most hearing people who have ever interacted with you primarily think of you in one word: Deaf. To be clear, this is only my guess, largely based on how I’ve seen society treat any minority, and I certainly don’t condone the thinking. In the new deaf world however, this would change; you would likely still be deaf, but now you and your deafness would be the default norm as hearing is today. How does this change you? (if possible, try to answer this last question from the understanding that you don’t get to take your current knowledge of being deaf with you to the reimagined world. You have to grow up in that reimagined world just like you did here). For the hearing: If you were anything like me as a kid, one day you might have been surprised to learn that there was an adjective for people who could hear. If someone had asked me to describe myself in terms of my ability to hear, I’m pretty sure I would have said something like, ”um, well… I can hear things. I’m not deaf… is that what you mean?” I think there’s a very obvious reason for my childhood surprise/confusion: When you belong to the default normal group in a society, you become blind to the very thing that ensures your normalcy. When you’re hearing in a hearing world, you hardly ever have to think about hearing. But in our reimagined world, this is now all reversed. Can/how do you cope? How are you different than you are in the present day world? (if possible, try to answer this last question from the understanding that you don’t get to take your current knowledge of being the hearing majority with you to the reimagined world. You have to grow up in that reimagined world just like you did here). \n",

      "What's your advice for making a deaf grandparent feel included at dinner? I'm not sure this is the right sub for this, but here goes. This weekend, my grandmother turns 95, and my family has a big dinner party planned for her. However she's now almost completely deaf (has been for about a year), and my family members don't really know how to handle it--mostly people yell a few things in her direction, and then just carry on with conversation as if she weren't there. I've noticed she gets very depressed and withdrawn during group outings like this.  What can my family and I do to make her feel involved and part of the party? Any thoughts, tips, or links to online resources would be welcome! EDIT: Thank you all for these wonderful suggestions! I think the party went extremely well. The restaurant was not an ideal setting, just as everyone worried. It was a fairly dark room and the TV was blaring the basketball game all through out the place.But I brought my iPad and a bluetooth keyboard. During lunch I sat right next to my grandmother, and basically provided closed captioning in the Notes app with the font size turned way up. As people came over to greet her I transcribed what they said, wrote up toasts as people gave them, and paraphrased the conversation at our table (I also asked her lots of questions). It took a little while for her to get used to it, but I think she really appreciated it. She also was able to learn a lot about what everyone was up to (generally she just smiles and nods when people talk to her). And sometimes at the table she'd chime in with a comment on whatever we were talking about. It's rare that she talks just for the sake of conversation! She even told us that the restaurant we were at was a dive when she was a teenager--none of her friends were allowed to go there.By the end of lunch several people asked me about what I was doing, and one of her home care aides said that they would look into getting a similar set-up to use with her all the time. Hopefully this will help her feel more connected in the future. When we got home we all played Scrabble, a favorite of hers. Anyway, THANK YOU.  \n",

      "How could computer vision tools help you? Hello everyone!I’m a researcher at the University of Washington and my work focuses on projects at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision. My current project looks to take advantage of recent advances in these two fields to build tools that can aid in the day-to-day lives of the blind and visually impaired.In that regard, I’d like to ask your help in brainstorming some of the functionality and capabilities that you would like to see from such a tool. I don’t want to structure your feedback, so feel free to answer in any form.Here are some questions that I have that maybe can help your responses:1) Would you be interested in a tool that can use computer vision algorithms to map the space and objects around you and then relay that information back to you using natural language?2) Do you use mobile applications such as VizWiz or oMoby for everyday tasks? There’s probably more, but these are two I’ve found information about. What are the strengths of these mobile applications? What functionality do they lack that you would appreciate? How could their offerings be better?3) How would you prefer to interact with such a tool? Would you prefer to snap pictures and ask the tool questions about them? This is the VizWhiz model. Would you like it to ubiquitously record video and describe your surroundings to you? Would you like it to to take snapshots at consistent intervals and describe how your surroundings have changed from before?4) How much do you use or would want to use these types of applications? Are you interested in a tool that you can use whenever you need it such as pulling out a phone at the grocery store to check the price of an item? Or would you be more interested in technology that becomes a far more integrated in your life such as the ubiquitous video example above.5) What are some tasks that you perform that you think would be easier with a tool that could describe your surroundings to you? In what way would you foresee yourself interacting with the tool to simplify the task?I hope these questions help clarify the type of information I’m looking to gather. Once again, though, feel free to describe anything that comes to mind. I’m interested in any and every way that you feel computer vision and computer-generated language tools could enhance your everyday life. I’m very excited about your responses!Here are some articles on the existing applications I described above:1. VizWiz.    2. oMoby.   \n",

      "Feedback on entrepreneurship project! Hello everyone,First of all I am not blind, I am here because I am starting a college entrepreneurship class. I decided to start a product aimed at helping blind people, so I'm in this subreddit to present my idea and get some feedback, and also to ask some more questions.So my idea, put quite simply, is this: I want to create glasses which come equipped with a camera, GPS, microphone and a speaker (last one still debatable). The goal is to train an AI model that receives video from the camera on the glasses, and the proceeds to identify everything within the video (trees, poles, cars, people, dogs, crosswalks, etc....). Using this model, my idea is that blind people can interact with the glasses in order to receive information about their surroundigs.Some examples of functionalities: The user can request the glasses to guide him/her to a certain place using the inbuilt GPS, and a route is generated. The person will then receive voice indications to reach their destination, while at the same time being also warned of obstacles and dangers that may appear on the way.At any time, the user can request to be informed of everything that is in front of him. A voice will then describe everything that the camera in the glasses is detecting at that moment.The glasses will also be able to read text, so a blind person can pick up a book that's not in Braille, and request the glasses to read the book for them. The glasses will then read the book to the user through paired bluetooth headphones.I have no idea of how blind people do their shopping, but if they do it as everyone else, then the glasses can also have a functionality that helps them at shops. For example, it can guide you to certain areas within the supermarket, or read pricetags of products to the user. This idea is still under works, not sure about it.In order for the comunication between user and glasses to be as normal as possible, I am thinking of using a chat bot like chatGPT to perform comunication, which writes almost like a human. &#x200B;So this is the current state of my idea. However, as I am not blind, I have no clue if these are actually functionalities that would benefit blind people in any way. So I have these questions for every blind person in this subreddit:What is your honest opinion of my idea? Is there anything you would add? Would you buy my glasses it for yourself if they were real and worked well?In your daily life, what are the hardest obstacles you have to face that could perhaps be solved with technology?Do you use any type of technology in your daily life which helps you with your blindness? If so, what technology is that?&#x200B;I want to add that if anything I said in this post offends you it wasn't my intention, I am simply trying to get some insights into the life of blind people so that I can work on ideas that can have a meaningful impact on their lives. It would be amazing if blindness could be cured, but that isn't realistic just yet. So the best next thing is to work on tech that assists blind people in their struggles as much as possible. I hope you can help me with this! Thank you everyone \n",

      "Update to Braille Music Notator, my free online utility Hello, /r/blind! I posted a year or so ago about my online utility, [Braille Music Notator]( which has the primary aim of making braille music notation more accessible to sighted musicians and music teachers. I've been working hard on it and am excited to announce an update to the utility and its first official beta release.The update increases the music symbol vocabulary quite a bit, but the thing I'm most excited about is that it now does a pretty good job of reading BRF files created in other programs, like [GOODFEEL]( or the online [BrailleMUSE]( system. Because a single braille character can have several different meanings in braille music notation, the utility uses algorithms to determine each character's meaning contextually. It's by no means perfect, but then the program is still in beta.Needless to say, I'd love any feedback anyone is willing to provide. Because the program is primarily designed for sighted users, it is very graphic in nature. However, I have tried my best to make the utility WAI-ARIA compatible and tested it with screen-reading software. In this update, I've included a setting to switch the accessible output from descriptive text (for a screen reader) to the current line of braille (for refreshable braille displays). I am sighted, and have no refreshable braille display to test with, so I'd especially love feedback on this aspect of the utility:- How does it work with screen readers?- How does it work with refreshable braille displays?- Is it even useful at all for visually-impaired users?I'm going to post at /r/webaccess as well here in a little bit. Thanks so much for your time... have a great weekend! \n",

      "Anybody watching Wednesday? The audio description is fantastic! So, I'm presonally conflicted about them making a teen drama about Wednesday Addams. But I have to say they did a great job. Wednesday is perfectly played, rhe show is a decent blend of deadpan humor, creepy stuff and straight drama, and they even got Christina Ricci into the cast.The reason 'm posting here, though, is the FANTASTIC audio description. Literally the best I've heard. The narrator describes everything, without any of those awkward \"what happenwd there?\" gaps, and her narration perfectly suits the mood. It flows so well, and sounds like this show was made for audio only, like an old radio play.I am a huge fan. \n",

      "Join the Call for Passage of a Canadians with Disabilities Act! Barrier-Free Canada/Canada Sans Barrière info@barrierfreecanada.orgJoin the Call for Passage of a Canadians with Disabilities Act!Do you think Canadians with disabilities should be able to travel on airplanes or trains? Do you think they should have equal access to services provided by the Government of Canada? Should they be able to enjoy whatever CBC posts on its public websites? Should they be able to enter their neighbourhood polling station and independently mark their own ballot? The parties plan to spend billions of dollars on new infrastructure. Do you think they should ensure that public money is never used to create new barriers against people with disabilities?  Many of over four million Canadians with disabilities still don’t enjoy all of these opportunities. They face too many accessibility barriers. They should not have to individually fight these barriers, one at a time, by endless human rights complaints. They need Parliament to pass the Canadians with Disabilities Act to ensure that the federal government does all it can to ensure that Canada becomes barrier-free. The US passed the Americans with Disabilities Act 25 years ago. It’s time for Canada to catch up!The October 19 election gives Canadians a unique opportunity to move forward on the long road to a barrier-free Canada for more than 4 million Canadians with physical, mental, sensory or other disabilities. Everyone needs a Canadians with Disabilities Act! If you don’t have a disability yet, you will get one as you grow older. So far, the Liberals, Conservatives and New Democratic Party have not made this commitment in this election. In the 2006 election, the Conservative Party promised a national Disabilities Act. To date, it has not introduced that legislation. The Green Party has promised to pass a Canadians with Disabilities Act, but has not committed that it will fulfill the principles for that legislation that Barrier-Free Canada developed. Barrier-Free Canada, a non-partisan, volunteer, grassroots movement, advocates for the Canadians with Disabilities Act, to lead Canada to become fully accessible to all people with disabilities. It is non-partisan. It doesn’t endorse or oppose any party or candidate. You can help!

      "I wish I knew of this subreddit earlier Hi y'all! I'm profoundly deaf with two CIs. I had gradual hearing loss but the cause is still unknown. I was educated at Magnolia Speech School in Mississippi to learn how to hear and speak before mainstreaming into first grade. I have had only two close friends who had CIs growing up. Now I am the only deaf person in my group of friends at this point in my life. I have been blessed to have had people who were patient with my hearing struggles, but it is nice to have a subreddit of people who \"gets it.\"I do have a slight complaint though: The mods shouldn't be removing \"self-pitying posts.\" Our struggles are real and frustrating, and we should have a safe space to vent. Growing up I've learned to hide my insecurities from my hearing friends because whenever I did share them they'd snap back: \"Well why are you telling ME this? Who cares? Get over it!\" I love inspiration as much as anyone. I adore Derrick Coleman for Seahawks and Heather Whitestone - the deaf Miss America 1995. We can draw strength from each other but we should be able to share our bad moments too. With that said I hope to join this community to learn and be inspired by y'all. Thanks for reading!  \n",

      "Vent of my own Hi everyone! Some of you here probably know me as someone that likes to help out and answer people’s questions. Although today I have something to vent about. Last year sucked mostly because I worked at Target and the store director at Target didn’t appreciate me signing with a friend that is a coworker even tho coworkers are allowed to communicate with others. The most amazing thing about working with this coworker is she’s my best friend, would always stand up for me when I couldn’t hear what the leaders would say. She would confront them without hesitation. An issue came after, my other best friend and her were married but after their divorce. The guy best friend expected me to not be friend with her anymore, and then as was on as we knew she had a new relationship. At first right after the divorce, he wanted to slander her name and make her be the most horrible person when she did none of those horrible things, all to kick her out of the ASL community and all of the deaf friends (5-6 deafies) would stop being friends with her. I was the only one to try to stop him from doing that, but it still ruined her world. I was the only deaf friend she had, and I knew her dream is to be an interpreter and to protect the deaf community. He expected me to tell him about the new relationship that she told me that she would prefer to tell everyone herself. He decided to not be friends with  me because of this. The reason I said that was another issue is because the guy is really popular in the deaf community. As a deaf person myself, he still excluded me from the local deaf community. Stopped inviting me to his asl socials and parties. I didn’t only try to stop him because it was to protect her but also because I knew he could be a better person than ruining someone’s life. I don’t regret protecting her, as she helped me grow so much into the person I am. Although I still host my own ASL socials with people who can still come and if they want.Recently, another change happened which is the hearing side this time. My grandmother (bestest friend) passed away and I never felt such disconnect with my family/extended family. No one in my family knew asl, and the whole time I was only able to get along well with others because my grandmother was around. She would interpret (from Spanish to English) for me and make sure I understand. It really sucks, but at least I have my best friend and another deaf friend checking on me and supporting me. \n",

      "Questions about writing about a deaf character in a novel I plan on writing a novel with a deaf 14 yo girl as one of the protagonists and I hope you can answer some questions. I first became interested in deaf culture when I met a deaf woman (who has sadly passed away since then) a few years while working in a nursing home, and I learned a little bit of some dialect of ÖGS (Österreichische Gebärdensprache - Austrian Sign Language) from her. I did a lot of research (back then because I was really interested in this culture I hadn’t known anything about, and again now for the novel), so I think I won’t make any too egregious errors. And she won’t be defined by her deafness the way a lot of characters with disabilities are. But there are some aspects I wasn’t able to find definite information on.The girl can communicate verbally, she and her parents know ÖGS, she can read lips enough to talk to others without too many problems (yes, I know lip-reading is nowhere near perfect) and to follow what the teachers say in class (and gets help from her seatmate if she can’t). So now to my problem. There are a few options, and I’m not sure which one to use, which one is realistic.1)She’s almost completely deaf. I think that would be the most interesting one to write about. Problems: a) It’s set in present-day Austria, so afaik there wouldn’t be much of a reason not to get a cochlear implant (parents aren’t opposed to it since they aren’t part of Deaf culture; Austria has a healthcare system that actually works so the implant would be free). b) Being deaf I assume she wouldn’t really be able to follow conversations by reading lips or to communicate verbally (even if she lost her hearing after developing speech). Am I correct about these assumptions?2)She has a cochlear implant. From what I’ve read, it seems that most people achieve very good comprehension of speech if they receive the implant at 1 – 2 yo or shortly after the loss of hearing at a more advanced age. Do there still remain problems even if you do understand speech? (Apart from having to take it off at e.g. the swimming pool)3)She has an implant, but it doesn’t work as well for her. Is that realistic nowadays? Or do most people get great results provided the implantation takes place as stated in 2)?I’d be very grateful if somebody could help me with these questions. And I hope I didn’t offend anyone when I wrote »most interesting«. This is meant in a literary sense, where problems are always more interesting to write about, of course it would be great if everybody could restore their hearing as perfectly as possible. \n",

      "Comment from a respected member of a deaf college forgive me if a reply all is not in order herejust wanted to note that the RIT/NTID students' Communication Access letter of Dec 7 requests re: training is not just for faculty and staff but also for administrators and specifies a need for training in Deaf culture and working with students with intersectional Deaf identitiesalso i wanted to share my concerns about some terms that are being used here and in other places  - the term communication is used sometimes when in fact people really mean languages and other times the term language is used when folks really mean communication systemsi think its very important for us to understand the difference some folks have been referring to sim-com (simultaneous communication) as a contact language but it in fact is a contact system often referred to as \"contact signing\" - it is NOT a language and generally not effectively used beyond very brief and specific exchanges.  some other folks have been using the term communication preference, which is an uncomfortable term to me.  Academia no longer use the dismissive, inaccurate, and offensive term \"sexual preference\" so i am puzzled as to why we at NTID are still using the term \"communication preferences\" again.  many moons ago when we first had a strategic plan we identified ASL and English as equally respected languages of our community.  given the fact that the majority of the people with power and privilege at NTID are English speakers who hear - it has not always been self-evident that American Sign Language is truly equally respected at RIT.  The grand experiment has only gone so far as many folks cling to comfort zones - speaking and NOT signing in public spaces and only lifting their hands when they notice a Deaf person looking their way or telling a Deaf colleague \" you have lovely speech - you should use it more often\" etc  there are many more and worse examples I dont want to dis RIT as in many ways it is a GREAT place.  with the increase of Hearing RIT students taking ASL and minoring in ASL and Deaf Cultural Studies - we see that the Grand experiment is being realized by the students more and more - but not so much by our faculty, staff and administration as a whole.The RIT/NTID Communication Access letter mentions microaggressions and i imagine the Ebony Club students address this also (i have not seen their letter).  As a white hetrosexual cigender partially Deaf fully sighted faculty member - i have alot of privileges that i need to acknowledge and unpack.  as i have experienced oppression and erasing actions by colleagues because of my sex and my being Deaf, i am sure that i have exhibited biases and ignorance in interacting with members of our community and welcome the future training.  I ask that we ensure we bring culturally competent experts in for the training and we follow our students lead in wanting a safe, healthy and egalitarian climate. thank you for allowing to say my piece.  \n",

      "Big decision regarding CI, your opinions would be very much appreciated! Hey all, hope everyone had a great Christmas!I posted awhile back [here]( about my history and how I'm in the process for receiving a cochlear implant. I am deaf in my left ear, as I have been since I was a baby, and I wear a hearing aid in my right. However, my hearing is declining, and it was recommended by my long time surgeon/ENT that I get a CI in my left.  After reading all your amazing comments and messages, I was feeling a lot better about the process, and I figured I'd likely get at least SOME benefit. I want to thank you guys again, because it really did ease my fears and even educated me a bit.However, shortly after that post, I had a CI assessment appointment. It was about three hours of testing with an audiologist (whom I've never met) that works strictly with CI people, assessments, surgeons etc. I was originally told back in September by my surgeon (I've known him for several years, he is a fantastic person and a wonderful doctor) that I would likely get a CI in my left ear, where I've been deaf since I was a baby. Okay, fine, I went into this assessment focusing on my left ear. But not 20 minutes into the appointment, pretty much all my hope was shattered. The audiologist and I began by talking a bit about my history, a bit about what my expectations were etc. My mom sat in for all of this as well. This audiologist said that the chances of me getting any real benefit in my left ear is slim, and that I should instead go for surgery in my right ear, where I have some (but declining) hearing. She was very blunt, and seemed to heavily lean on this whole \"get your right ear done despite the fact that it may not work and you could end up being totally deaf\". This ticked me off, a LOT. I don't know about you guys, but this is a big decision, and I'd rather take baby steps and do my left ear first, rather than jump right into my right ear, destroy any hearing I have now, only to have it not work, or maybe I'll absolutely hate the way it sounds. I know the chances of me having decent, conversational level hearing in my left ear are slim, especially since I lost my hearing in that ear before I learned language. But I knew that walking into the appointment, I knew that a CI is not some sort of miracle worker that will give me normal hearing. I also pointed out to her that I had received some messages from you guys, some of who went through nearly the exact same thing and ended up with hearing that really was a lifesaver and changed their lives. She replied with things along the lines of \"but were they deaf in one ear and not the other? Did they learn language before they went deaf or got a CI? You can't listen to what people say online, you just can't.\" I see where she's coming from with that, but guess what- I've had audiologists look me right in the eye and say \"looking over your papers, you shouldn't be speaking at the level you are, you shouldn't be functioning so well in language\". Well too bad, I am. I learned to read faster than anyone in my class, I've always been at the top of the class in English, I'm intermediate in French and I'm working on German. Sometimes what's on paper is not always an indicator to how things actually are. Who's to say that this situation is any different, what if I end up getting real, solid benefit from a left CI?I went from feeling awful about all this, to hearing from you guys and feeling positive, to being torn back down less than a week later. My mom insists that this audiologist probably has people skipping into her office, thinking they'll be hearing at a normal level, and it's likely her job to bring them back down to reality. Fair enough, but I was already at a realistic level of thinking when I walked in, and now I'm just back to feeling horrible about all this.The bright side is that the audiologist, my surgeon, and a couple other professionals involved are going to have a meeting and review my case on the 6th. A couple days later I have another CI assessment, with a different audiologist I believe. After that, I'm going to talk to my surgeon one-on-one. He knows me and my family, he knows what I want to do in life, and I honestly do value his opinion over an audiologist who met me for three hours.At the end of the day, it's my decision which ear to do first. The only problem with doing my left ear, is that if it doesn't work well, it could take a year to schedule another surgery to do my right ear (If the left doesn't work I WOULD get a CI in the right, I just want to exhaust all my options before I destroy the little hearing I do have). I'm not trying to paint myself as some special snowflake where everything may miraculously end up working. But nothing in my papers, nothing about my situation indicates that I'd end up functioning as well as I have been, who's to say the same thing won't happen with my left? Also, I know my hearing in my right will eventually disappear completely, but what if that day is 10 years down the road? What if I have 10 more years of some hearing- I could go to university with hearing, I could get married with hearing, I could hear my child's voice. I don't want to risk all that because some audiologist recommended I do my right ear first and have it not work out. I hope you guys see where I'm coming from, and I would really appreciate any opinions, advice, or even a bit about what you'd do in this situation. It's a big risk, and there's so much I want to do in these next few years that I really need to think this through, and I genuinely do want all the opinions I can get. \n",

      "Can anyone tell me if this is close to \"father\" in Braille? I want to get this as a gift for my father for Christmas, but I'd like to know the accuracy. Hi! First off, neither my father or I are blind, but I think that this is a beautiful idea. I recently heard of this company:  partner with nonprofits to provide vision through corrective lenses or cataract surgery to someone who would otherwise not be able to afford it. I really like their simple bracelets and I love that my money can simultaneously serve two purposes: a meaningful gift and helping those with vision impairment(s).  I'm thinking of getting my father the \"Father\" bracelet. I know nothing about Braille, so I'm not sure if the engraving in the bracelet is actually \"Father\" in Braille. There is a disclaimer from the company that states, \"Note: bracelets are braille inspired and not intended to be read by blind individuals,\" so I don't expect that it will be completely accurate, but I'd just like to see if it is at least close. I also might purchase one for my sister, so if anyone could take a look at this one as well, that would be wonderful:  anyone can help, it would be great! Thank you :)(Edit: Forgot to include the \"Father\" link  \n",

      "I met a deaf person for the first time today. I'm a 32 year old lady and I have never met a deaf person before today. As a hearing person I just don't have any exposure to deaf people in any meaningful way. Today was actually kind of great. Story-I drive a Vespa and I work for Disney. I keep my gate key on my lariat so I don't have to dig around in pockets or turn off my scoot. Someone ran up to me from the neighboring gas station and asked where I get my scooter repaired. Their friends scooter had just broken down and he needed some help. So I went over and showcased that I know absolutely nothing about scooter mechanics. I did show there is a manual kick start if the electric starter isn't working... So I have that going for me. BUT I did meet a very delightful deaf guy with a busted scooter! His friends were there so it made talking a little easier. He was able to read my lips, but got stuck a few times and the signing from his friends helped. He noticed my badge and was excited to learn that I am an Imagineer (theme park designer). He said that before Cars Land opened in Anaheim he and his Deaf West Theater group were asked to visit and give feedback. Small world! I asked what it was like to experience a Disney Park being hearing impaired. He quickly corrected me and said, \"Deaf, not hearing impaired.\" Which was actually great. I had no idea that was the term preferred. And he went on to explain that visuals are everything. Think about where you are and what can be seen. Signs and visual queues are so important for navigation and to tell stories when you don't have sound. I tried explaining that once I went to the park and tried to experience it as a deaf person. While I could still hear, it was interesting seeing what kind of offerings cast members had to accommodate. Theatrical shows were intensely boring as you get a mirror and ticker tape dialogue of the show. I wonder what we could do better.  I am a designer. My bread and butter is art. I use visuals every day to tell a story. Honestly though. With this simple interaction I will now think about how I can be a better designer for people that experience the world differently. I will put more emphasis on vibration, effects, physical experience and smells when I think about attractions now. Anyway. Kinda cool. TIL and it was a great experience meeting someone that was deaf for the first time ever. I'm mad I didn't catch his name!  \n",

      "Suggestions for at home help a blind friend I have a blind friend who only has one relative who doesn't live close and no friends since he went blind suddenly after moving into a new community.  I work 6 hours a week doing clerical work for him, but due to my schedule I cannot give him much help learning the phone and computer. He went to the Lighthouse for the Blind, but it is extremely difficult for him to get on a special bus from our county, spend some time there and return home.  He lives far from a city, and the closest Lighthouse as well.The Lighthouse helped him on the phone learning the phone and the Typer Program, but he really needs at home help.  Lighthouse stopped giving him phone help after awhile because they said they could only do so for a certain  period.  Said he should have \"gotten it\" better after the phone help they gave him. He is a brilliant guy and had a lucrative psychology business before he went blind so I'm sure he could handle what he needs to learn with practice.  After a year of being blind he luckily gets around his home with a cane.He does get  a few hours of cleaning and shopping help from CARES for which he pays a certain amount monthly.  However, this help is frequently \"spotty\" with people not showing up.Is there a program or can you give me a suggestion for him to help him get at home help from someone who knows accessibility iphone and screenreader? (He has NVDA and a Typer program go practice with.)  I've listened to it with him a few times, but even as a sighted person, I find it extremely hard to listen and understand what is being said.  Just seems like the speaker goes too fast as the cursor is being moved.Thanks for any suggestions. \n",

      "\"I’m not hearing. I’m not Deaf. I’m an 'inbetweener'\". An article by my friend. Saw this post by one of my hard-of-hearing friends on facebook and she said she was fine with my sharing this on /r/deaf. > I’m not hearing. I’m not Deaf. I’m an “inbetweener”.> An inbetweener is one that falls in between the hearing culture and the Deaf culture... which makes the inbetweeners have their own culture.> Before I go deeper in this, I am going to emphasize that I am aware that there is much controversy surrounding the cultures and I do not want anyone trying to make any points or arguing on this. I am not asking for any arguments. I am merely trying to educate people that there ARE differences between the deaf, inbetweeners, and hearing cultures. There is no wrong or right decisions on this matter and that is why you will be deleted if you try to argue with this post- *(she originally posted this on facebook)* because it is how I feel and how people who fall in between the two categories feel. It's called respect for different cultures and backgrounds and I don't tolerate people who don't accept different cultures.> I was born deaf, got a Cochlear Implant at 5 years old and have since classified myself as hard of hearing. Some “inbetweeners” call themselves different names- hard of hearing or deaf (because technically, without the Cochlear Implant, users are deaf). But they aren’t culturally deaf. Not all people who are hard of hearing technically fall in the inbetweener culture- it all varies on their cultural backgrounds and personal preferences.> I’m an inbetweener. I grew up in the hearing world – granted, there were many struggles along the way, but I just kept rolling on and adapting. But what many people don’t realize is that there is a huge difference in the two cultures of Deaf and “inbetweeners”. Inbetweeners don’t entirely fit in the Deaf culture. Inbetweeners have their own struggles in the Deaf culture. It’s like culture shock for inbetweeners, because the deaf culture is entirely different from the inbetweener culture. And there should be more information pushing that type of knowledge out there. Just because I’m an inbetweener does not mean I have a preference for one culture over the other cultures. I’m simply explaning what type of culture I naturally fall into as an inbetweener.> What I've noticed is that over time, the group of inbetweeners has steadily grown over the years. We can fit in the hearing world and usually don't have any problems with daily things. But we've developed this culture because of our similarities- just like how every other culture has developed.There is a wide spectrum that inbetweeners can fall in- some relate more to the Deaf culture and some relate more to the hearing culture. Some don't have a preference. Some inbetweeners didn’t learn sign language until a much later age due to personal and life choices and some inbetweeners have never learned sign language. Some inbetweeners learned sign language at an early age.> Inbetweeners aren’t technically classified as “Deaf” because it would be like classifying a native Spanish person as an American person. I know sign language pretty well after learning it at 19 years old, but my sign language skills are never going to be top notch… and they never will be. I grew up talking and listening to people on the phone.> With that being said, inbetweeners have different needs than Deaf people do. I’ve always rejected sign language interpreters because it actually takes much more effort for me to follow along with a sign language interpreter than it would take reading the presenter’s lips. Even then, lip reading is not an exact science and it never will be. It can get exhausting after a while after using your eyes so much for reading lips and using visual cues to adapt to every social situation. But that doesn’t mean I avoid those situations. I love socializing—I can randomly go up to different people and start up a conversation over the smallest thing.> What works for Deaf people doesn’t always work for inbetweeners. Many are capable of carrying their own conversations with spoken English and don’t need a sign language interpreter. It can be hard for inbetweeners in group meetings because you don’t always know who’s talking or who’s saying what. And how much you understand is usually correlated with how tired you are that day (in my personal opinion). I can usually talk on the phone with people, but there CAN be people that I don’t understand well on the phone- people with accents, people who mumble, people who talk a million miles a hour, or phone calls with a lot of background noise. Oh, and those with hearing aids and/or older Cochlear Implants don’t have selective hearing, so all of that background noise gets combined in one sound which takes more effort for that person.> Inbetweeners are perfectly capable of carrying themselves in the hearing world, taking care of themselves and usually don’t need much help- the only help we really need is in group situations or presentations/plays/classes (this is all based on individual preferences) a closed captioning interpreter, closed captioned movies and TV shows, front-row seats for reading lips and visual cues, and other accommodations.> Growing up as an inbetweener in mainstreamed schools, there were struggles about how to accommodate my disability. FM systems in classes didn’t help because it was like adding static to your already imperfect hearing. Some inbetweeners don't rely on sign language interpreters (some do) and it isn’t helpful if schools try providing sign language interpreters…. Because it’s not their first language. Using an English interpreter for someone who speaks Spanish is completely defeating the point.> The whole point of this article is to educate people on how different the Deaf and inbetweener culture are from each other. The two cultures have more differences than similarities. Inbetweeners are in between the Deaf and hearing cultures, hence the term “inbetweeners”. Inbetweeners have different needs than Deaf people do and there isn’t enough education out there about the people who fall into the “inbetweener” category. I wanted to write this article and educate people so they can realize that inbetweeners and Deaf people are not in the same culture and have different backgrounds.> There is no wrong or right when it comes to cultural backgrounds. We all have our own preferences. We ALL have a degree of cultural influence growing up and it is the overall cumulative experience that shapes us. Growing up in a hearing world and then being exposed to the deaf world is like being born American and moving to Mexico. There are cultural differences. Just because you happen to be an inbetweener doesn't mean you are part of the deaf culture. Every person has theirown culture and the culture of inbetweeners isn't always found in Deaf culture. It’s all a matter of cultural backgrounds and personal preferences… but just be aware that not everyone fits 100% in the hearing or Deaf culture. Which is why the “inbetweeners” culture has formed as a result.> If I could rewind back in time and change anything my parents did growing up, I wouldn't change a thing. Because I get to be part of this awesome inbetweener culture. And there are many people out there who happen to fall in this category, too. \n",

      "I finished my first semester of ASL! Hi! I finished my first semester of ASL and I'm so happy! My mom was against me taking ASL because she thought it \"wouldn't really do me any good\", but I've proven her wrong over the last few months. I'm finally starting to make friends with other Deaf/HoH people my age (hello /u/SweetGerberaDaisy, and thanks for putting up with my awful signing!), making me feel a lot less isolated. I also have a hearing friend in school who's fluent, and I've gotten to the point where half our conversations are signed and she can fill me in if I miss something our dance teacher says. I'm also feeling confident enough in my ASL skills to start going to ASL coffee socials next month. Oh, and my boyfriend is learning alongside me, which is awesome. I haven't really been adjusting that well to starting to lose my hearing, and taking ASL has definitely helped me begin to feel more comfortable with myself. I'm so stoked for ASL 2 next semester. Anyways. Sorry for the ramble. Just feeling a little proud of myself and super excited and wanted to share the happiness :) \n",

      "Screen-reader Accessible Gaming News Roundup Number 2 It's Sunday morning again!  And that means it's time for another post on screen-reader accessible games!  At least, seeing as I have enough stuff to justify making one, anyway.  Don't be too disappointed if this isn't a weekly feature; the industry is small enough that I'm honestly surprised I have things to write about two weeks in a row.  Let's start with some bad news, to get it over with.  In [a blog post]( on his website, Erion has announced that he will no longer be developing Dragonflame, a LUA-based engine to help developers code audio games.  However, he has released the sourcecode, if anyone else wants to continue the work.  In his post, he also discusses the worsening difficulties developing audio games for the Windows platform, and speculates on what, if any, future Audio Games may have on other platforms.  But as one project comes to a close, another one begins.  In [a post made to Reddit,]( /u/InclusiveGames announced they're starting \"an upcoming independent game development studio that aims to produce games for all to enjoy.\"  No word on screen-reader or audio access, but they have announced support for colour blind players, so with a slogan like \"All Games, All Gamers\" we can always hope.  In continued good news, The Wastes, the text-based game I covered last week, has made changes in [version 0.7.5]( to make an already accessible game even more accessible.  You can now disable the ASCII art, and disable sound completely, from within the options menu.  The developer has been spending a lot of time interacting with the blind community, both on Reddit and elsewhere, so if the ASCII art and sounds that were slightly too loud put you off at first, now is a good time to give this game another try.  There has also been discussion of the game that /u/Huw2k8 developed previously, called warsim.  It's a text-based empire simulator that's just as accessible as The Wastes.  While he's no longer working on it, if wargames appeal to you, it might still be worth [the download.]( IOS news, a game...toy...poem...app...thing called [My Secret Hideout]( recently came to my attention thanks to [a podcast]( posted to Applevis by Cherokee Eagle.  While the app was originally released with screen-reader support in 2011, it doesn't seem like the community took much notice of it back then.  From the app description:> My Secret Hideout is a wacky, creative thing set in a treehouse. It’s not like any app you’ve seen before. Play around with it! > Drag leaves down and attach them to the tree. Every time you add a leaf, the description of the treehouse grows and changes. The changes are random... aren’t they?Lastly, a website called [Empire Directory]( with a focus on listing and ranking text-based games of all sorts has recently been launched.  While not all the games listed here will be accessible, it could be a good place to start, if you're looking for something new to play.  If you are interested in gaming, there are lots of other communities right here on Reddit, too, where you might find fun games to try every once-in-a-while.  Here are some of the ones I subscribe to:* /r/MUD: discussion of MUDs, online multi-player games played over telnet (or your favourite MUD client).* /r/TEXTVENTURES: play by forum adventure RPGs, happening right here on Reddit!* /r/INTERACTIVEFICTION: the place on Reddit for Interactive fiction, everything from Zork to Curses to Lifeline.* /r/DISABLEDGAMERS: gaming is for everyone, and it isn't just the blind who struggle to play games.  From subtitles in games to modified joysticks, it all comes up here.  What other places on Reddit are you a part of, gaming or otherwise?  Let us know in the comments!

      "Hello /r/Blind! Hello /r/Blind community, I come to you seeking your help in becoming a better assistive technology instructor. I've been an instructor for the past five years but even so, I feel that there are areas in which I can improve. It is with that desire to improve that I come to this community to ask questions. I'd like to lead with three questions to commence this inquiry. First, did any of you members of this subreddit obtain technology training at a center/facility? If so, what did you enjoy about the instruction provided? Second, what did you not enjoy and if you could suggest an improvement for the instructor, what would it be? Third, was there any concept, software, hardware that you would have liked to learn but did not. Any feedback would be great as I enjoy working with the visually impaired to help continue developing their skills in all areas of technology.  \n",

      "I want to make a movie about a blind girl, but I don't know anything about blindness... Hey!I am an 18 year old girl who'd like to become a movie maker one day. Today, while seeing a friend of mine playing piano with her eyes closed, I got the idea to shoot a movie about a blind teenager girl, who has some problems in her every day life, like she sits alone in class, people don't watch out for her in the grocery store, her mother has to help her comb her hair and go to school, but then you can see her going to the empty school's hall like she's gone the way a million times, sitting down in front of the piano and playing these incredibly beautiful songs. First of all, what do you think about this idea? Is it realistic?As said in the title and as you probably noticed, I do not know anything about blindness. (While we're at it - Sorry if I write anything inappropriate or disrespectful, tell me immediately) This is why I have a loooot of questions and I hope some of you might answer, so I can make the movie as realistic as possible. Thanks in advance!Did/Do any of you experience non-acceptance like I described or other similar problems?Does a blind person always have to carry a cane and this yellow armband with the three black dots? Could I replace those things or leave them out?Are there any small details in behavior and movement that I probably don't know about but are kind of typical?As this is a really really small movie, I wanted my friend (who is sighted) to play the girl. I know she is a good actress and can play the piano, but is this appropriate? I don't know if her eyes are going to be visible, but if they are, would she keep them opened or closed?I'm sorry if those are dumb questions, I just want to be as accurate as possible and cover the topic in a respectful manner.If there's anything else you want to add or comment, feel free to talk about anything you want! I'm interested in every little piece of information!Thanks again :) \n",

      "I need help with my family movie night It's here again our weekly family movie night! I really enjoy Friday nights  just sitting with my family and watching what ever movie my Deaf 5 year old picks. but I also end up  just a little bit sad every movie night or most times I watch a kids movie with my little guy.  It usually starts with him sitting with me while we watch and I hear them make a joke and I laugh then a few moments after I laugh he will start to laugh and that's where it really gets me. He is not laughing at the joke that was made he is laughing because he felt me laugh and wanted to do the same. He's 5 so his reading skills aren't there enough for him to get what's going on with the CC turned on (they are still turned on even if he can't read them). Here's where I'm coming to you for help.  I am hoping that  you can take some time out of your day and reach out to disney+ and share that  while closed captions are great it doesn't do anything to help kids who can't read yet and that the only way for them to truly be all inclusive for at least kids movies they need to find  a way to add in an interpreter in the corner. Now I know of signup.com and they do great work but its not the best solution  for the problem.So I am asking you to go to [ go to the bottom of the page and fill out a feed back form or even better give them a call or use the live chat and express how important it is for kids to have real access to movies/TV shows  and not a bare minimum that still doesn't work for them. \n",

      "Light Sensitivity Glasses/Eye Patch Hello! I am not sure if this is the best place to ask this but I am not sure where else to. I am nearly blind in my left eye, I can still see things out of it but barely and what I get out of it is pretty useless. It is very likely I will fully lose vision in it within a few years. But for now (and I assume even after I lose it) the eye is extremely light sensitive. It is usually imaginable, but recently I struggle to even go outside or look at screens or even have a lot of lights on without pretty intense pain. I should probably talk to my doctor for some ideas, but I want to get some to bring him before I do so. &#x200B;So I am wondering, what is the best way to help with that? I know some visually impaired people simply wear sunglasses to help with that. I already wear glasses so I was figuring I could just do that for my bad eye, like this ([LINK]( Image description: A young smiling woman wears a pair of glasses, the lens on the left is black and opaque while the right lens is completely clear). &#x200B;But I feel like that would allow light in from the top, bottom and sides. So I was wondering if I should instead wear an eye patch over my glasses which covers the top, bottom and sides like those patches given to help treat lazy eyes ([LINK]( Image Description: A smiling man with dark brown hair wears a pair of glasses, the right lens is uncovered while the left is covered with shaped blue cloth which blocks the top, bottom and side spaces of the glasses). &#x200B;However, given that those far more impaired than me with presumably worse light sensitivity get by fine with sunglasses, I am wondering if such a thing is necessary. I could just wear a conventional eye patch, but I'd like to be able to easily take it off when in very dim light so as to not constantly keep my bad eye covered. I would also prefer not to look like a Bond villain if I can help it. I am well aware there may be other options, perhaps some kind of contact, but I am unaware of them and would like to know them. &#x200B;Sorry if this is a silly question with an easy answer! Thanks for any help! \n",

      "Firearms Instruction? Hello all, I'm a firearms instructor and was wondering if anyone had any experiences taking firearms classes or lessons. If you have, how did the experience go, what were the biggest challenges, and how were they addressed? Did you take them as a brand new shooter or did you have prior experience and how did that factor in? If you haven't ever taken a firearms course but have an interest in doing so, what would your concerns be and what kind of solutions do you think would satisfy those concerns? Essentially, I'm interested in figuring out what the best way to go about teaching a deaf person firearms fundamentals would be. Because of the safety concerns inherent in handling firearms, communication is extremely essential to keep everyone safe, but of course to communicate via sign language you need to use your hands which are occupied with holding a firearm and keeping it pointed in a safe direction. Lip reading of course isn't super reliable, and usable hearing may be blocked by earpro (the range will definitely still make you wear these even if you're deaf). While I can fingerspell using the ASL alphabet pretty well, that's about as far as my fluency goes. I'm familiar with a wide variety of assistive technology and deaf/hearing communication devices, but I feel like these would be less than ideal to use at a range, and again the problem of needing to use your hands for most of them. There are speech to text solutions of course, but then I would also need to make sure I have a screen visible. There are already nonverbal signals that can suffice for some things - since at ranges everyone should be using hearing protection, for major safety commands hearing can't be relied on, so there are almost always visible signals for commands like \"cease fire\", but these cover a very limited set of instructions. What do you all think?  \n",

      "Anyone have any CI or just general hearing loss support? Hi all, throwaway because I never like getting personal on my main account!Anyway, when I was about two years old my family noticed I stopped responding to sounds from my left side, tests ended up showing I was completely deaf in that ear. As time went on, the hearing in my right ear fluctuated, a lot. To the point where it was almost daily, and I'd gauge it by how loud I had to turn the TV haha. There were days I could hear the TV at a 4, and days I couldn't hear it at a 12. So it was pretty strange to the doctors, because once your hearing goes down, it's pretty much supposed to stay down.Though I went through years of testing and a surgery, no one ever figured out why I was deaf in my left ear, or why my hearing fluctuated in my right. Despite that, my speech is perfect. I was put in speech therapy and that didn't last long once they realized I didn't need it at all. I wore a hearing aid in my right ear at the beginning of grade one and I've never had many issues, I never considered myself deaf in any way either. I refused to go to \"deaf camps\" or anything like that because I considered myself \"normal\". I was a dancer, an all star cheerleader, a model, I was in the top 10 of all my classes; I was just fine.  Fast forward to about two years ago (16), I had always had ear ringing but this was getting bad. There came days where I couldn't hear what my mother was saying right in front of me, the ringing was so incredibly overpowering. On top of that, I lost my hearing for a solid month, just out of the blue, no reason at all; I couldn't hear a thing. My hearing came back from that but now, at 18, my ear ringing is terrible, and my hearing in my right ear, has declined dramatically in the last six months. It was recommended by my long time ENT that I get a cochlear implant in my left ear. I agreed, and I started the process for it about three months ago. It's a really slow process, and I'm hopefully getting the surgery date PLANNED (not actually getting the surgery, just getting it booked) sometime before Christmas, fingers crossed.I try not to think about the CI at all, I try to focus on and pray about where I am right now. I graduated high school and always planned on taking two years off, however, I can't hear much at all so I had to leave my fantastic high-fashion retail job. I live in such a small place that there are no data entry or \"behind the scenes\" jobs out there, especially for someone who's entry level in that field, so I try to fill my days with volunteering, dog walking, etc. It's pretty hard on me because I went from traveling Europe, working two jobs, having a ton of friends and going out frequently, to just sitting at home waiting for the next appointment. I'm too self conscious to go to parties and interact with people who are not a family member or close friend; I'm so afraid I'll miss something in the conversation, or I'll get hurt one day because I didn't hear someone sneaking up behind me etc. I went from being the center of attention at those gatherings to not knowing a word anyone is now saying; it's a huge change for me.I don't want to focus on the negative, but has a CI ever truly not worked for anyone? I'm terrified I'll go through all this, and turn it on and it never works. So far the results seem to point toward the fact that it will indeed work, but I am SO anxious that I'll never get the life I had before this back; and I'll have to change my entire future because I'll be deaf forever. There is nothing wrong with being deaf, I'm simply not used to it. I don't have years of experience and tips and tricks under my belt to maneuver through daily life without hearing a thing. I went from being the all-American (well, Canadian) cheerleader to being jobless and scared to even go to the grocery store alone, in less than six months. Does anyone have any advice? Does anyone have a good CI story, or just something to maybe encourage me to not worry so much about what'll happen once I do get it? I'm trying to be positive, but I'm anxious about the situation I'm in right now, and I'm anxious/terrified about what will happen if I get the CI in my left ear and it doesn't work. Edit: I'd like to thank every single person who has commented and messaged me. Whether your experience was positive or negative, it has honestly helped me so much to see what everyone has gone through. It's settled my nerves quite a bit! I had no idea I would be getting this kind of support and this type of discussion, and I love it. I'm feeling so much better about my hearing and the future, it's been a long time since I've felt that way. Thanks again to ALL of you, hope y'all have a merry Christmas:) \n",

      "How do I actually USE a magnifier to read? No, really. First time poster, long time lurker. I have severe RP and am registered blind, still have... some functioning sight, enough to be moderately independent.Reading has always been a struggle for me, for the longest time for paper it was nose to the page kind of situation, but my sight has deteriorated to the point I can't really read from paper anymore. Letters, books, magazines, they're all just a haze to me.So I've been given various magnifiers by my local vision aid clinic, and to be honest they're all useless to me. Yes on a perfectly flat laminated sheet of high quality print it works if I push my face against it, but outside of the clinical setting its a nightmare. I put these magnifiers to the page and they cast a shadow on the page, even the ones with the light built in. Or they just don't focus, and I have the strongest ones they said. Honestly the best thing I've found is an app called weZoom for Android. But that's only half the solution.I only have two hands, and I need on to hold the magnifier, ideally both to help adjust the zoom and contrast and stuff, so the book is constantly closing or flipping pages if I'mnot holding it tightly, or the letter I'm tryjng to read is flopping over in my hand as I hold it up, or it falls off of the book rest thing they gave me. The book holder doesn't even hold the book right and the little legs o score part of the page, it's frustrating.I genuinely feel like I'm missing something. If I had four arms this would be perfect, but alas I am only human. How am I supposed to use any of these magnifiers in the real world?FWIW I've tried eBooks, the kindle is hard to see, maybe the newer ones with the warm Back-light are better, but money. And not everything is digital, especially stuff like letters and what have you. The Fire is okay but it wears on my eyes Fter a while, especially trying to focus on text.Am I being thick? \n",

      "I am hearing and I want to know more about how differences in abilities (such as hearing) affect not one's self‐perception, but rather one's self-presentation. I recently watched the documentary/film *Through Deaf Eyes* in my Social Psychology class. It was especially enlightening for me because I have never really interacted with the deaf community. Throughout the film, it was pretty clear that deaf people (at least those in the film - don't want to wrongfully assume anything outside of that) do not view themselves as having a disability.* Summer Crider: \"In terms of a disability, I don’t view myself as having a disability whatsoever. I function like any hearing person can. My deafness does not deprive me of anything. I can do anything I want. Except maybe sing.\"* David James: \"Being deaf is, well, it’s part of me. It’s something I have to deal with, but it doesn’t keep me from being happy. It doesn’t make me either happy or say. It’s like being a man instead of a woman, or being tall instead of short.\"So here are my questions: since how you personally perceive yourself is often very different from how you present yourself to others, how do differences in abilities such as hearing affect self-presentation? And how is your self-presentation affected by your self-perception?                                                                                                              .                                                                                                             .[Disclaimer: I have not had much interaction with the deaf community, so please forgive me if I say anything offensive]. \n",

As an engineer, my passion is to create a better quality of life for all and I wanted to reach out to the visually impaired community and offer my help, as much as I can. Currently, my project involves creating a harness with a camera that uses computer vision and machine learning to help detect overhanging objects and other hazards that might not be detected by a guide cane. From what I understand, guide canes can often get stuck, are difficult in detecting drop-offs, and lack in detecting overhanging objects. This device will aid in the function of the guide cane by detecting objects that are out of range of the cane and hopefully provide some better security to the wear. In addition, we are working to incorporate the detection of oncoming vehicles to help with crossing the street. We hope to eventually create it can be used on its own. I wanted to reach out to this community and ask: what would you like to see in a device like this? What are some common troubles you have with navigation in your daily life? How can the function of guide canes be improved? How can I help you feel more confident and have more independent mobility?&#x200B;Thanks in advance for your help and all the best to you! \n",

I've been reading your posts and enjoying them for a year now. Recently I've finished my newest YA novel, the main character is a Deaf girl, but the story isn't about being Deaf or \"overcoming\" \"adversity\" it's just about her and her hopes and dreams same as any person. My agent just read it and had lots of good things to say. But before we can send it to any publishers we both think the book could use a read (or two or three) from a Deaf reader to make sure I am being respectful and accurate.

      "This is your sign. I’ve been seeing a lot of comments, both online and in person, from blind people wanting to try out assistive tech and either not knowing where to start, or feeling ashamed for trying. So, I figured I would just post this in hopes of giving people the little nudge they need to get started.If you’ve been hesitant in the past to begin using a cane, learning braille, or trying out a screen reader— especially when the rest of society tells you you’re “not blind enough” to use those things— this is your sign to take those first steps. If you’ve losing vision, and you’re reluctant to try assistive tech because you feel like it’ll make you stand out or look weird, this is your sign to just…try them out. If you’ve been blind your whole life, or for a while, but haven’t yet learned independence skills, this is your sign to start. If you feel like using assistive tech is a “last resort” or a sign of you “giving up” on yourself or your vision, try thinking about this. Assistive devices were created to help people, not cast shame on them. And if AT is something dirty or awful that should be avoided… what does that say about the rest of us who use it on the daily, especially those of us who don’t have a choice? Are we dirty or disgraceful? No! And neither are you! This is your sign to try AT out, even just a little. Who knows, once you try it out, you might not find it as weird or offputting as you think.If you’ve been wanting to try out some AT, but you feel like it is a daunting task to learn an entire system, or you’ve been waiting for government services or experts to teach you to do things, this is your sign to take matters into your own hands. You don’t have to learn the system all at once. Just start small. Also, there are more resources for learning these types of things than you think. You just have to be willing to look and give them a try. Practice walking a little with a cane (you can get them for free from the [NFB]( or for pretty cheap from [DCanes]( Also see about getting some O&M training. But if that’s not available to you right now, just try holding your cane and feeling things around you. Get a feel for guiding the tip of your cane around objects that you bump into. Take note of different textures, and what you can and can’t feel with your cane. Try finding things with your cane, like the curb cut on a sidewalk, or your front door. Just get out there and start using it and familiarizing yourself with it.Try out a screen reader! You can set the speed and voice to whatever makes you comfy. On your phone, VoiceOver and TalkBack both have tutorials that show you the basics of their respective programs. Try something simple, like sending a text or looking something up on Google, and work your way up to larger tasks. Feel uncomfortable being the only one in the room with a talking phone? Throw on some earbuds! As far as anyone else is concerned, you’re just listening to music or a video. Check up rail resources! There are so many out there, but I don’t know if I could name them all here. Some are better than others, but check out all the things that bro can do for you. Even outside of basic reading and writing, braille can help you access and learn all sorts of written languages, math and science, and even music (music braille can be tricky, but as somebody who used it a lot in college it can also be a lot of fun)! Not to mention, the skills you learn from reading the small dots and find details with your fingertips helps you learn to hone in your senses. For me personally, I found that learning braille when I was growing up helped me be able to notice fine details with my fingers when I’m doing something unrelated, like knitting.And if you’ve already started, I just want to say that I am so proud of you! No matter when you’ve started, or under what circumstances, starting is always the hardest part. But here you are, doing exactly that. I am so proud of you!TLDR: no matter what your vision journey is, or your feelings about assistive technology, if you want to start using them and gaining independence skills, this is your sign to start! \n",

I do NOT sign, I was told it was a hearing world and \"I\" had to adapt.  So I learned to read lips and tried not to mind when I misread and people labeled me as too stupid to bother with.  Sighs*I did not get a cochlear implant (Lied Cochlear, Boys Town, Omaha, NE) till my children started using, mommmmmmmmmmm you didn't hear me right as their favorite excuse.  And while the cochlear is a miracle, it def has it's drawbacks and I would just asoon not wear it, but find it useful.  I would also appreciate people taking into consideration here that any comment I make is only my opinion and not meant to offend anyone. It is just that I have lived my life deaf and how I feel about things is because of the life I have lived.  Blessed be people, may white light and happiness be yours : )  lololol and nooooo, I am not a witch, nor even pagan, I do happen to believe in God, church- not so much. I tend to like the American Indian belief and think we should be thankful. I have always just liked the phrase, blessed be : )  \n",

      "Deaf friendly podcast of \"Serial,\" my friend sent me... Hey,I’ve been wanting to tell you about this, but I wanted to be sure there was a method in which you could read the Podcast first.For me most podcasts are boring. It’s people sitting around yaking about whatever, usually geeks. This one is soo sooo soo different!I'm a 100% LDA in my 30's. All my close friends are hearing. They do a great job including me. My bestie Kim recently shared this with me so we could chat about her favorite podcast during our frequent marathon texts. \"So, I had been hearing about this Podcast “Serial”. Everyone that talked about it was so excited and so I thought I better check it out. I’ve been listening on my (too short) commute the last few days. I’m 3 episodes in and I'm freaking hooked. I can’t wait to get to Listen to the next episode. So, I found that the transcripts are avail on [HERE] ( sure you start with Episode 1 and read them in order or it will be ruined.I hope that you’ll check it out. I think it would be a really fun thing for Your hubby to listen to on his commutes as well. Then you all could chat about it.Always want to share with you what’s cool in the world.Check it out. \n",

      "I have a crush on a deaf guy I've recently been talking to this guy in my class. He's super sweet, intelligent, kind, and exactly the type of guy I want to be with. We've only met in person twice outside of class, but I really enjoy his company, and I feel really happy looking into his eyes. Maybe I'm moving too fast, but I haven't been in a lot of relationships, so I really value those that do happen. I'm not completely sure if he actually likes me, but I have a good feeling he does.He doesn't speak and I have little to no knowledge of ASL, so all of our conversations are through text. When we meet, we write to each other through our phones. He recently lost his, so we had to pass my phone around back and forth in order to communicate. That means we can't text anymore, but at least I know he wants to talk to me.We don't talk with high frequency, usually only a few messages a day, since we're both pretty busy in our 3rd year of undergraduate, but he's always found time to reply to my message.  Lately he's replied to me with less frequency, but at our last meetup he said he didn't know I was gay (though I thought I made it pretty obvious), so I'm hoping that he was avoiding me because he was afraid of the possibilities of starting a relationship, like I am, and really really really not because he's not interested.I'm very glad to be in an inclusive school and I know a little bit about Deaf culture. I notice my hearing privilege more when I think about the seemingly minor things I can do but he can't or at least not easily, such as being able to understand what the person is saying at the same time as they are saying it (interpreter delay), setting up one-on-one meetings with ease (he would have to require an interpreter if it was a hearing professor), and asking for directions (we were lost on the way to the bus stop that night, so I asked a passerby with my all powerful hearing voice; he told me he didn't get any of it). TL;DR - Just wanted to share my super gay feelings. \n",

      "Trial by fire I’ve recently been considering moving to a new city and I’m wondering if this community has thoughts or experiences with moving somewhere new while being totally blind. There are three main reasons why I’m considering a move. Listed in order of importance:1.I want to move to force myself to learn orientation and mobility skills + life skills. I currently live with my parents even though I have a decent work from home full time job so I rarely have to do every day things like shoveling the driveway, doing groceries, doing a deep clean of the house, cooking, etc. I know that there’s nothing stopping me from doing these things right now but there’s nothing pushing me to do them. I don’t have to so I never feel any urgency to do them. I figure that moving to another city would kickstart my independence journey. A trial by fire, if you will. My OandM and life skills are pretty decent right now but I still feel like I could be much better.2.The company I work for has an office in the city I’m looking to move to. I want to start working in the office for career advancement reasons. The company isn’t forcing people to come into the office or anything like that. It’s more that I really want to get to know my coworkers better because they’re very intelligent people and networking is especially important in my field.3.I’ve made friends in the new city already and the blind community is much more active there. All that said, to me, it feels like moving to the new city is the natural next step for me but I’m unsure if moving out alone to a new city, away from my support system is even possible. Sometimes I think I’m not being realistic but other times I feel like I need to be more ambitious. I’ve considered taking a 1-year lease somewhere and treating it like a trial run. I rarely struggle with indecisiveness but it’s been hard to make up my mind in this case.  What are your thoughts? \n",

      "How to discreetly be better at customer service for Deaf (especially monolingual) customers? Hi, I work at a small restaurant and coffee bar that just opened in Birmingham's central train station in the UK. It's important to me that everyone feels welcome, including Deaf and disabled people. Today I served a gentleman who volunteered that he was deaf, and he mostly is non-speaking. We did get there with some pointing at menus and ingredients and writing things down, and I'm pretty polite and unflappable. However, I think in this man's case at least it would have been more dignified to know and use a few basic BSL signs (as opposed to trying improvised gestures), which I've been studying tonight. It is one of our country's native languages after all, and Birmingham has a large Deaf community.My question is this -- in the past I've known that some of my Deaf friends who sign have not wanted me to sign with them, for example to avoid outing them in front of others, or because they feel the path of most dignity for them around hearing folks is to lip-read. Where a Deaf customer and I are clearly struggling to communicate that way, though, how is it best to offer to sign (or to ask if BSL is the sign language they use)? Would just discreetly signing \"British Sign Language?\" be adequate?In terms of my ability -- I am intending to take classes soon, but after studying tonight I am capable of some polite greetings, signing \"British Sign Language,\" \"What's your name?\" (for order tickets), \"please\" and \"thank you,\" and \"see you again,\" as well as \"I'm sorry, could you write it down?\" I can certainly do better, but in one night I think it's a good start. I'm not asking for any help with learning so much as advice on how to navigate this situation politely and helpfully. \n",

      "Perspectives on Vision Loss from someone who is Visually Impaired [Cory's Story: Graduating from Grief to Growth]( one and all to this most unusual Tech Connect!   Today we are sitting down with Mr. Cory Ballard, CATIS and Director of Technology at Vision Forward Association, to discuss the social and emotional impacts of vision loss and various strategies for navigating them.   Most of the time we skip over this part of the story and focus on the assistive technology tools that help folks live their lives. But today we want to take a step back and examine more fundamentally how people cope with a loss of vision.  Cory explains how, because he was born with sight and ended up losing nearly all of it by the age of twelve, he can empathize with the serious social and emotional stresses that such a transition can put on a person. As such, our goal today is to open up discussion of these struggles and walk through how best to navigate these situations from the perspective of a student, employee and parent.   Still have questions for Cory? Then post them down in the comments! Or leave your own stories about how has being visually impaired presented particular challenges for you?

      "Help me pick a computer for my mom My mother has partial vision but it’s terrible. She’s been recently diagnosed as legally blind. I’m looking for a new laptop/tablet that is easy for her to navigate. She likes to spend hours working on her budget in excel, so I’d like to get her something that has a keyboard and can manage spreadsheets, but she needs large font. She also likes to watch Netflix from bed, (currently on her phone) so I’m thinking maybe something with a bigger screen like an iPad or surface tablet. I like the idea of a touch screen so she when she’s browsing she can easily zoom into things, and it will be less clunky when she wants to watch videos while laying down. I want something where you can customize font size and some voice command capability might be good too. What do you all use and what would you recommend for her situation? If you don’t know of good models, what are some features you most use, what screen size do you prefer, etc. anything helps. Thanks! \n",

      "How to help a blind person? Hi all. I was cycling to work today and noticed a blind person who was trying to cross the street (Britain, narrow street but with lots of traffic including buses and bikes). There was no traffic light with a beeper and she seemed like she could use some help, so I asked if she was OK. She said she was unable to cross the street, so I offered to help. She seemed glad and happy to accept. I told her I would park my bike and be back in ten seconds. I stood next to her and said I was there, then waited for a few seconds until the road was clear, said 'we can go now' and we started walking. I lightly touched her shoulder with the tips of my fingers because I thought it might help her to know that I was there. When we were about three feet away from the other side I said 'we're almost there', she said 'thanks', i said 'have a nice day' and she went on her way.Afterwards I wondered how a pro would have done it. Blind people of reddit, if you are trying to cross a street without a beeper/dog/etc, how would you liked to be helped? E.g., light physical touch yes/no; offer to help you get to wherever you're going yes/no; any particularly useful communication tips? \n",

      "How to get to know a deaf coworker better? Hi! I am hearing and I work at a school where some classrooms are for kids who are deaf or HoH. I have a huge crush on one of the aides who works with one of the kids. I don't get to see much of him during the school day because we work in different classrooms, but I smile at him every chance I get and he smiles back. Yesterday, I was running in the rain and while waiting to get back inside my room, I realized he was walking behind me and we had the longest eye contact in the whole world while smiling. I'm dumb as rocks and I wasn't sure whether he could hear or not, so I said \"hi\" while stupidly turning away because I got shy. He didn't say anything back so that's how I figured he was deaf.I'm still really interested in him though. He always seems so happy and patient with the kid he supports and that smile of his is so warm.  I've never asked a guy out ever before and I don't want to seem too forward or eager either. I don't even know if he has a girlfriend lol. And he hasn't made any attempt at communicating with me besides smiling. My childhood friend is HoH, and she told me not to get too excited about the eye contact because it's just deaf culture and that I'm a dumbass for saying hi without looking at him. I wholeheartedly agree lol.Should I just give him a piece of paper with my number on it or should I just wait 'til he initiates anything? I literally can't stop thinking about him.Thanks so much! \n",

      "U.. take advantage of Schedule A Hiring Authority and apply to work for the Fedwral Government Hi all, I am blind and work in Human Resources for the U.S. government. I have seen several posts about seeking employment recently, and I wanted to drop in with an option I find lots of blind people don’t know about.For some background, most government agencies advertise their vacancies on  There are two common ways for jobs to be announced, delegated examining and merit promotion. Delegated examining jobs are open to the public, but absolute preference is given to disabled veterans. Basically, if a disabled vet applies to the job and is qualified, it is, for all intents and purposes, illegal to pass over them for another qualified applicant who is not a veteran. To be clear, some non-veteran applicants do get selected from these announcements, but as regular disabled folk, we can circumvent the veteran preference on DE announcements by applying to merit promotion vacancies.Merit promotion jobs are open to current or former federal employees and special hiring authorities. One of these authorities is called Schedule A which is a path to hire people with severe physical, mental, or psychiatric disabilities. Merit promotion jobs do not give veteran preference. Applicants are selected by merit, as the title would suggest. This means that all qualified applicants compete with each other based on education or specialized experience.   you will need to get a letter from your physician, vocational rehabilitation counselor, or other professional certifying that you have a severe disability and qualify for Schedule A hiring authority. There is a template online that I can link if anyone is curious. The individual writing the letter does not need to disclose the character or nature of your disability, merely that you have one.Once you have your letter, begin looking for jobs that you may qualify for. Make sure to read the “ who may apply” section of the posting to ensure it says something along the lines of people with disabilities, Schedule A, or special hiring authorities. Also read the qualification requirements in the announcement to ensure you will be considered. Then start slinging applications.       The government is on a huge kick right now to diversify its workforce, and they are having a hard time recruiting people with disabilities in particular.I am happy to answer any questions, or provide clarification for any part of this process. I do this for a living,  so I do consider myself a subject matter expert. TLDR: if you are disabled, and want a government job, get your  Schedule A letter, and apply to merit promotion announcements on USA jobs.  if you have lots of free time, apply to the delegated examining (open to the public) announcements as well, but don’t be surprised if you are passed over  for a disabled veteran. \n",

      "I had a really awful experience using my voice today This is my first ever Reddit post, but I have been lurking a long while. I'm not usually the sort to post stories, but I feel pretty down today. I was in wholefoods with a hearing friend, we were signing in the isle for a couple of minutes. I look over and see an attractive girl looking at us and a few minutes later I see her again in another isle. She waves at me, so I smile back. She then asks me how I am in BSL, I respond and she does some basics back. I asked her if she knew a lot of sign and she told me that she didn't, but that she was learning BSL from a friend. This hasn't really ever happened to me before, so I was a bit stunned. I've had people try to communicate with me, but never really experienced a total stranger start using sign with me. So I kind of internally panicked a little bit and asked her something too complicated and she interrupted me and started indicating that she didn't understand. She then started apologising and I tried to let her know it was okay but she wasn't understanding what I was saying in response so it got a bit awkward. I tried to smile and make friendly gestures. She was quite sweet and seemed keen to communicate with me and I suppose my 19-year-old brain just wanted her to stay, so I decided to use my voice.She was cute and I didn't want to stop talking to her, I'm a bit socially awkward and it was a snap decision. Basically her whole facial expression just changed, she looked terrified and I got embarrassed and the situation became awkward. In the end she just smiled politely and waved goodbye.I will likely not be doing that again any time soon. Hope this doesn't come across as self-pitying, I just needed to vent. Told my dad about it, he didn't really understand why I was down about it and told me to laugh it off. I will eventually, it's not the end of the world. I just feel discouraged.Hope everyone else is having a good day/night. \n",

      "How To Get Accessible Audio Described HDTV Over The Air with an Antenna These are some quick instructions that really need further expansion.  But I thought this should be documented somewhere.  At least in Ottawa Canada, all of the channels I can receive with a TV Antenna broadcast audio description, and are in HD.  Unfortunately, no current TV supports switching to the described audio track when using an antenna.  But if you want to pick up the audio description, there is a solution!  The First Thing You're going to need is an [HD HomeRun Connect](  This is a small device that connects to a TV antenna, and to your home network, so any device on your network can pick up TV signals.  It's super easy to set-up; it's almost plug and play!  Make sure you get the HomeRun connect, though. The Extend and Prime models compress the TV signal, and as a side-effect, remove the audio description track.  Once you have the device, and have plugged in internet, power, and your TV antenna, the only thing you need to do is scan for available channels.  To do this under windows 10, open file explorer, and select \"network\" from the tree view/sidebar.  Once the list of network devices has loaded (this might take 30 seconds or so), you should see a device with a name that starts with \"HD Homerun\".  Press enter on this device, and your web browser will open.  On the page it shows, choose \"channel line-up\", and then press the scan channels button.  Scanning for channels takes 1 or 2 minutes, but the web page will tell you the percent complete and the number of channels it's found.  After the scan finishes, you'll get a table showing the channel number/name/logo of each channel you can receive.  Now that the device itself is all ready to go, you'll need to download and install [VLC]( if you don't already have it.  Once VLC is installed, find a channel you want to watch on the channel line-up page of your HD Homerun, and press the applications key over, or right click on, the channel number.  In the menu that comes up, chose \"copy URL to clipboard\" (or similar, depending on your browser).  Next, go into VLC, press ctrl+n, paste in the URL you just copied with ctrl+v, then press enter.  If all went well, you should start hearing TV audio.  Now it's just a matter of going to audio on the menu bar, going into the \"audio track\" menu, and choosing the appropriate audio track.  At least in Canada, this is usually called \"Track 2 Visual Impaired commentary\" or \"Track 2 ENN\".  If audio description is available, the rule seems to be that it's always the even-numbered tracks.  For example, track 1 is regular audio, track 2 is audio described English, track 3 is regular French audio, track 4 is audio described French, and so-on.  Well, I've only seen one station offering 4 audio tracks; most only offer 2, so I don't even know if more than 4 is even possible.Thus far, desktop VLC is the only player I could find that will allow you to select the audio description track.  The IOS and TV OS versions of VLC will work with the Homerun HD, but for whatever reason they only show the picture, and won't play any audio at all.  The Channels App for the Apple TV won't allow you to select the audio description track, and doesn't respect the audio description setting in accessibility. Kodi works fine with the Homerun, but won't allow you to switch audio tracks, as far as I could tell.  So, at the moment, this is kind of limited.  But it's better than nothing, and it does prove that Canadian broadcasters are broadcasting the audio description track over the air.  Now we just have to convince app developers (other than VLC), TV makers, and so-on, to support it.   \n",

      "Ipad instructions for the blind? Hey guys!I bought an ipad for my mom (who is blind) for Christmas.

      "Deaf Texans-- check this out  of VLOG Announcement: Learn About Upcoming Public MeetingsTexas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, Office for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services  This opening slide is titled, “VLOG Announcement:  Learn About Upcoming Meetings.”  The VLOG is provided by the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services Office for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services, and this slide includes the agency’s logo.Hello, this is Christine “CB” Buchholz .  I’m from the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, known as DARS.  I work under the Office for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services, known as DHHS.  We are making this VLOG announcement to tell you about some very important public meetings taking place in Texas.  The purpose of these meetings is to discuss if services at DHHS should be transferred to Centers for Independent Living, known as CILs.  This slide is titled “Outsourcing” and defines the word outsourcing as meaning “to contract out.”Script: The word outsourcing means contracted out or run by another entity, and the sign I will use for outsourcing is this [sign for forklifted]. CILs are not residential facilities.  Their purpose is to serve people with all disabilities, and they are operated by persons with disabilities.  Services provided help persons with disabilities to live independently and include:•information and referral;•independent living skills training;•advocacy; and•peer counseling. This slide is titled “Centers for Independent Living,” and includes the text: Services provided include:•information and referral;•independent living skills training;•advocacy; and•peer counseling.Services also help Texans with disabilities transition from nursing homes to community-based residences, or transition from secondary education to postsecondary life.Script: To be clear, the transfer of DHHS services to CILs has not happened and has not been decided yet. This is why we are holding these important meetings in three cities in Texas.  The meetings are an opportunity for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community to give DARS their feedback and opinions.DHHS works in partnership with people who are deaf or hard of hearing to eliminate barriers and to improve equal access.  This slide is titled “DARS Office for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (DHHS)” and includes the following text: Services include:•resource specialists;•senior citizen program; and•outreach work for the Specialized Telecommunications Assistance Program (STAP).Currently, DHHS has 11 programs or services, some of these services include:•resource specialists (RS) program;•senior citizen program; and•outreach work for the Specialized Telecommunications Assistance Program (STAP). There will be three public meetings in Fort Worth, Midland, and San Antonio.  You are welcome to attend at any time, but some meetings are specific to DHHS services.  Those meetings are labeled DHHS.It is very important for you to come to the public meetings and share your opinions or concerns, or to express your support for the transfer of these DHHS services to CILs.  Your feedback is very appreciated.The next several slides will show you the dates, times, and locations for each of the meetings.

      "Subreddit Changes- Let us know what you think Over the past week or so you have probably noticed quite a few changes around here. The newly expanded mod team has been working hard to make this sub even better. We hope this post will clarify all of the changes and where we are going.The most easily noticeable change has been to the sidebar. We have revamped it with resources, links, and information. We are trying to make the sidebar a good place to quickly access resources and are constantly working on keeping it up to date with relevant content.The other major changes in terms of content have been to the [Wiki]( The Wiki now contains listings of organizations that aid the blind and visually impaired by region. It is important to note that the Wiki is still very much under construction but it is a top priority of the mod team to make this resource as thorough as possible in a timely manner. If you have an organization that you believe should be in these listings please contact the moderators and we will make sure to add it as fast as possible.There have been more than just changes to the resources available on this sub though.  The CSS is in the process of a complete overhaul.  Improvements include increased text size and buttons for low vision readers as well as a more extensive and organized user and content flair system. In addition a light and dark mode is being added for readers that struggle with contrast. Controls for the light and dark options can be found in the sidebar if you choose to use them. There are several other projects in the works for the CSS and you can expect to see several new changes in the very near future.The last push we have been making is to start our outreach program. We now have an official Twitter account, [@BlindReddit]( that updates with headlines from the sub. This is just our first step in trying to reach out to the broader blind community.We hope that you are enjoying the new changes. If you have any comments, complaints, or suggestions please feel free leave a comment or message the moderators. We are very enthusiastic about feedback and we really take it to heart.Have a great day,Your Mod team \n",

      "Smart Bracelet that helps you navigate, Feedback! Hello all! I am currently at a startup weekend building a product for the visually impaired. We want to create a smart bracelet that allows users to navigate their environment through vibrations in their wrist. We ultimately want it to look like wearing two wide band-like bracelets on both your wrists. Say if you're walking down the sidewalk and there is a telephone pole in front of you, the side of your bracelet facing the pole would send you a buzz, notifying you that you're about to bump into the pole. With that brief description in mind, if you are visually impaired or you know someone who is, would this product be useful? Or would it be more useful for the sensors to be in a pair of glasses instead? Some questions that would greatly help us in our market research are the following:If you are visually impaired:What is the hardest part of your day? Getting ready? Walking to a destination?What are you currently using to get around?Is your day generally pretty structured or restricted because of mobility restrictions?What types of technologies do you use? Smart phones? Smart Watches?If you do use a smart phone what does that usage look like? talking into the phone?If you don't use smart devices what devices do you use? How is health insurance utilized for being visually impaired? Meaning what tools (seeing eye dogs, canes) are covered? Thank you so much for your time!  \n",

      "My Christmas Poem for the /Blind subreddit. We've again come to the edge, another year nearly gone,And for the facts of our vision problems, some of us have been fine while some of us have been put upon.Some of us have been hurt, slighted by those who see,And while the world can be cruel, we know this truth as fact indeed.But we are together, a whole made of many parts,Millions of pulses all with a single, beating heart.We are men and women held down by nothing but ourselves, Ready to extend a hand any time another asks for our help.Some of us love apple, some android, and yes windows too,We all feel the same emotions in our souls through and through.We've all come to be heard, to be felt in this life,We've all come to share as strangers, friends, loves, husbands, and wives. And so this year may come to an end, and we start another brand new,Just know that from my household to yours, Merry Christmas, bless you all... and I love you.-roman. \n",

      "I've met a deaf citizen, 23 years old working as a mechanic at the shop I visit. I got him social security going but he has no other help. Please help me help him! Greetings,I didn't know where else or who to go to for this so I figured to post here.  I know of a mechanic I deal with for car issues and I came across this young guy who was deaf.  His mother passed away at a young age and his father just cares for himself and works at a gas station. He has an older brother who is one of those guys that just stays home playing computer games.  I ended up taking the 23 year old to social security and as of April 1st he will be getting $500 a month, they will bump it to $700 if he can prove he pays rent.  What I wanted to know what else can we do to help him out? He can barely speak, I think he's been deaf since birth.  He can read a bit from my understanding but I believe (not 100% sure) that technology can assist him in some ways?  Perhaps some medical advice for him?  Any other benefits?  Kindly advise...This is in the state of New Jersey.  Thanks! \n",

      "Question for blind gamers about a dedicated blind stream. I often listen to streams while going to bed mainly hearthstone as it's mainly talking with the occasional sound effect. As I lay there I tried to work out what the cards were based on the sound and the commentary. I then got thinking is this what blind gamers do?I looked into gaming for the blind and it audio based. I was also curious on how they use the internet. They are obviously highly hindered in the visual awe some games provide but I'm assuming that their imaginations are alot more exciting? Therefore I was wondering if there would be any interest in an audio stream or a series of podcasts talking through the visuals sort of like a story? Or if anything like this exists so I can hear for myself.Gaming is my favorite hobby and feel rather blessed I can enjoy it and I would like to somehow help someone who can't enjoy it in the same way I can.Mac. \n",

      "R/Deaf I need your input. Me and my group are working on a college project. Basicly we're trying to develop a watch that vibrates when there is a significant sound diference between the sound captured and the ambient noise, making it easier for deaf people to be aware of their surroundings. For instances, if you're in a loud environment the watch will pick up the ambient noise and adjust itself to it, only triggering the vibration if there is a short louder sound. On the other hand, if you're in your house and someone closes the door loudly or someone calls your name the bracelet will pick up a significant difference between the ambient noise (which is almost none) and the sound it picked up, making it vibrate.So, with that said, it would be great if you could give us some feedback. And yes we're aware that there already are some products like this available but we're offering a low cost solution. Plus no product like this is being commercialized on our country.Your input would be of great help, please leave your feedback and feel free to add a few things of your own to our product. Your help is gladly appreciated! \n",

      "Intercultural communication Just seeing the post about ADA and interpreters, brings me to an opinion that I would like to put out in the world, and see if more people are with me on this.I think sign languages are excellent native languages, and of course learnable by hearing people, but I do think as well that sign language as is creates a communication barrier as well. I speak Esperanto and it drastically lowers the barrier to entry. There is also Toki Pona for which a signed mode has been created.I think there should be more work on creating sign languages, with a special focus on some kind of universal contact sign, something that's easy to learn for hearing people and Deaf people alike, and while not immediately giving access to ASL culture etc, could make intercultural communication easier and more effective.One very important element for this is more documentation on Sign Language and the essence of Sign Language. I would love to see more articles, videos and studies about the linguistics of sign languages, especially things like phonetics, so it's easier to both teach, self study and create sign languages.What do you think? \n",

      "Questions about closed captions I looked in the history, and similar questions have come up, but not quite addressed my questions. I am not deaf, but I sometimes watch Netflix with closed captions on. I've noticed incredible errors from misspelling major character names to leaving out entire blocks of speech.So I guess I have a few questions for those of you who are deaf.How satisfied are you with the quality of captions?It seems like every show is captioned differently. Which show would you say is the best at providing captions?How easy is it to notice when the caption misses something? I mean, I notice it because I can hear, but I have difficulty viewing both the text and the mouths, so when it's on mute I have more problems identifying those errors.Since reading lips is quite difficult, do you ever ask someone to tell you what you missed, or just deal with it and move on?Do you feel like you miss any of the context since you don't hear the intonation, or are you better at picking up mood from text then hearing folks (through practice)?Those are the main questions I have. I just feel like closed captions could and should be so much better, but I'm still super happy they exist in the first place. Anything else you want to share about closed captions or anything else in general would be awesome. Thanks for testing! \n",

      "Heads up that Ajit Narayanan - creator of Avaz, the only augmentative communication developer for a billion people in India, and overall incredible linguist/educator/engineer is doing an IAMA tomorrow at 10AM PST. We are dying for feedback from the the Deaf community(s)! Full disclosure: I collaborated in the creation of the new app ([FreeSpeech]( but Ajit is an awesome guy and the perfect person to ask questions about Augmentative and Alternative Communication app development, structural linguistics, international and Indian concerns in education, special education, SLP, politics ... [the man's quite the encyclopedia]( I'll be helping to answer questions as /u/lucasfreespeech.So - this may seem off topic here - but we have gotten TONS of feedback from deaf educators telling us that this is a great app for teaching syntax / morphology / general English literacy skills to kids who have grown up using ASL. I have no idea if that's true or not; we came into this knowing very little about Deaf communities and culture. Suffice to say we'd like your questions and feedback - although please post them in the main /r/IAMA thread tomorrow so Ajit can see and answer, as I'm not the expert.Meanwhile, check out his TED talk [here]( for some idea of what the new app is capable of - it's quite a leap forward, especially considering the price (ten bucks!)Come ask some questions tomorrow! \n",

      "3D Printed Braille-like Symbol Slate 3D print files available for free here: [ little while ago, I asked for some help designing a tool that would let me emboss geometric symbols onto plastic labels, like a slate and stylus embosses braille. u/kajashey kindly volunteered to design this for me, and this is the result.This 3D printed symbol slate works with a standard stylus, and is designed to take label tape that is 13mm tall, i.e. the label tape refills also used in Dymo braille labellers.  The slate is hinged along the top and a similar size to a braille label slate.  However, instead of braille cells, it contains a single line of ten geometric symbols as follows: nine dots arranged in a square, six dots arranged in a triangle, a triangle composed of three corners, a square composed of two square brackets with a dot in the middle, a circle composed of two round brackets with a dot in the middle, an angled line with a dot on either side, three vertical lines, a diamond composed of two angled brackets, and X and a Y.  Embossed versions of the symbols are included underneath each symbol, so you can feel what they look like.  More symbols can be created by only embossing part of a symbol, e.g. the nine-dot square could be used to make a single dot, a line of three dots, four dots in a smaller square, four dots in a larger square, &c.  Dots can be embossed by pushing down, just like a standard braille slate, but lines require running the stylus through the groove several times.I am going to be using this to create tactile versions of Rubik's cubes and other twisty puzzles.  While there are a couple commercially produced standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cubes, they aren't the nicest to turn compared to other modern cubes.  Plus, there are tonnes of other twisty puzzles that don't have tactile versions commercially available, including cubes with less pieces on each side (2x2x2), and more pieces on each side (4x4x4, 5x5x5, and up), puzzles with a different number of sides, like a pyraminx (four sides) or a megaminx (12 sides), and puzzles that twist in interesting ways like a skewb (a cube where you twist the corners instead of the faces).However, there are definitely other potential applications for this tool.  For example, I could see using embossed symbols to differentiate different pieces of a board game, or for marking appliances (if you need more variety than just bump dots for different buttons).If you do decide to print and use the symbol slate, we'd love to here your feedback.  I hope it proves useful to more people than just myself. \n",

I clean it, take it to the Apple Store cannot find anything wrong with it. My sister and best friend both try it, and they said “dude, it’s literally fine”. I’m like, ‘wow it’s working again!’ *put my AirPod in, hear nothing* The three of us just looked at each other all realizing what happened at the same time.See an ENT, then the audiologist, flash forward to now. Lost most of the hearing in my left ear at some point (no clue what happened… I have many health issues including passing out often) and thought it was just my AirPod for so long 😭😂 my Deaf friends think it’s hilarious, as do I.

      "Deaf reddit users: how do you prefer to be treated in public? A deaf man came into my restaurant tonight, and I went out of my way to make sure he had a good time. He couldn't lip read, and I couldn't understand him when he spoke, so we quickly switched to tablets/smartphones for communication purposes. He seemed OK with everything, but it got me thinking as a hypothetical: Where is the fine line between giving a deaf person special attention due to their difficulty communicating with most of the populace through traditional means vs treating them just like I would someone else and allowing them a sense of self-sufficiency? As a deaf person, what would you consider me adequately trying to accommodate your needs vs me being condescending or trying too hard in a busy restaurant environment?I feel like I did well. I tried to maintain a sense of honesty and respect with him. When he said or signed something I didn't understand, I didn't smile and pretend like I knew what he was talking about, but I also didn't attempt to treat him like he was in anyway weaker than me or broken. I feel like I did the best i could, but given that this was my first time in this scenario, constructive feedback is appreciated.On an entirely unrelated note, when I carded him he signed bullshit, which I immediately understood. This is my new favorite hand motion. \n",

      "learning to drive with one good eye. A little about myself,Am currently trying to get my Drivers license here in California, I've always wanted to drive ever since i was introduced to the very first Gran Turismo on the Playstation 1, I've gone to drag racing events at the Sacramento raceway park, Car shows, and Drift events just to watch because i love anything Car related.I'm almost completely blind in my right eye since birth, my left eye is fine though and all my vision is coming from it, but i still need glasses since i'm nearsighted. Basically every year i would go and take the permit test and pass with ease. The only reason i take it every year is because my confidence and courage to learn to actually drive a car tend to gradually diminish and i procrastinate until the permit expires, then the whole process repeats, which is sad i know.I have actually drove a few times, but in an empty abandoned naval base but never in a public street. I think the most trouble i have while driving is telling distance, since my depth perception is pretty bad. I tend to brake too early. Changing lanes is also a big challenge since depth perception is heavily involved with it as well. Is everything that i have trouble with normal? Do every new driver experience this as well?Will driving more and practicing help? I've practiced on a Infiniti G35 sedan which has 300hp+, would something that rides higher and slower or maybe a smaller car be more beneficial with the issue i have? A dozen optometrists and two ophthalmologist that i visited assured me that it perfectly legal and fine for me to drive with my disability.Any tips and advise would be much appreciated, sorry if i posted this incorrectly or if i didn't post enough, i'm still new at this reddit.

Tumor left him visually impaired - significantly so although he's developed an incredible amount of functional vision. Chemotherapy caused a stroke that has left him with r side hemiplegia and developmentally disabled. At some point he lost a lot of hearing too, no one knows why. He has cool, modern hearing aids but won't wear them.So now he's 18, healthy, 6 ft, 4 in. tall, rows crew, and super, super sweet. I think he's pretty cute. He's the strongest person I know, clever and funny. Middle and High School have been tough on him and he really doesn't have any friends. He's unconnected socially, except to me and his family, and our friends. He's got good connections with his teachers, and many other adults, but it's more about people taking an interest in him and breaking through his barriers, not about him trying, if you know what I mean.Obviously I think he's got a lot to offer other people, but he's been rejected so often he has retreated (and the bad vision/hearing plus no hearing aids helps him live inside a private bubble).This fall he'll start his senior year. I wonder if I shouldn't give one last push to encourage him connect socially, either at his school or on his crew team. Although there are plenty of assholes, it's a big school and I know there are good kids there, especially on his crew team.

Please forgive me if I am ignorant on certain aspects regarding the blind and please help me learn.  Do you play MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) games and if so, how did you discover them?  A little about MUDs before I continue, they are generally purely text based, online multiplayer games and a good portion of players are blind.  Some MUDs are laid back, while others are virtual worlds with a heavy emphasis on role playing.  MUDs number into the many of hundreds, although it does not mean they are all heavily populated.  The vast majority are free.  Also many of the game clients are free.  There are several public websites that showcase them.  MUDs come in many varieties of genres like adventure, modern, sci-fi, historical, horror, medieval, etc.  Some are based on the works of Lord of the Rings, Discworld, Dragons of Pern, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.  Others are a mix-match of genres or established material.  Many communities are accepting of new people and willing to help.  Full Disclosure, I will be linking this thread to r/MUD, as several people are interested in MUDs and the blind community as well.  So how did you discover MUDs?  Was it randomly searching the net?  Were you told by a family member or friend or a helpful organization for the blind?  How did you get the equipment to play them, such as a screen reader or sound packs?  Was it at full cost, half cost or no cost?  What can be done to improve the experience for blind users?  If you were not interested before, are you now?  I would be happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have.  And I am also interested to know what you use to play MUDs in general and what are some of your favorite MUDs.  Thank you for your time and patience.[View Poll]( \n",

      "I'd like to gather your thoughts and feelings on subtitles - what makes good subtitles good, and what makes them bad? Hey everyone. I work as a multimedia editor and one of the jobs I get tasked with frequently is subtitling the videos and animations that we produce. I get given the subtitling jobs because I really care about them, and I think I'm pretty good at them. However, it would really help me to get some feedback from the community that they are designed for.Tell me what makes good subtitles, and what makes bad subtitles. For example, one client we work for has a specification which requires 2 lines of text aligned to the left. I like the fact that a larger amount of text is on screen at one time, meaning that you can skim read it and revert your focus back to the content until the next sub appears. However, we don't tend to do this for other clients as the visual and motion guys don't think they look very nice.I worry that only having a single line, with not that many words, constantly refreshing at the bottom of the screen would constantly pull your focus to the subs and not give you enough chance to enjoy the content. Is this a fair assessment? Any other input regarding your feelings on timing, appearance or any other issue would be gratefully appreciated as I can use your comments to justify making subtitles the way you want to see them, not just what the aesthetes think looks best! Many thanks. \n",

      "Your opinion on Sign Language My 5 year old has moderate hearing loss in both ears. It's not expected to get worse, but I take that with a grain of salt because they don't really know what caused his hearing loss in the first place. He wears his hearing aids pretty well during the day, but gets fatigued of them around dinner time. Because I don't want him to associate negative feelings with them, I don't force him to wear them except when he goes to school (and even then, if the molds are getting too old then I'm a bit lenient). Weekends are also more casual since we don't typically do too much in the morning.Is it worthwhile to teach everyone in our family sign language? It feels like a big endeavor, but if it is something that others would recommend, then I would really like to. And I assume ASL is the standard, but I don't really know if there is anything else that would be a better language. As someone only recently introduced to the intricacies of the world of hearing loss, I am not exactly sure how to proceed.Edit - I just wanted to thank everyone for being so helpful! I was not expecting so much positivity and useful feedback. I'm going through all these links. They're great! Tonight my son and I went over a few words. He was picking it up so fast. I'm probably going to be posting in here more often as I haven't found much in the way of parenting groups for kids with hearing loss. THANKS!  \n",

I love the city but in recent years I've thought about living elsewhere.  I find myself getting tired of the expense, the noise, the grind, and am just curious about a different lifestyle. Maybe something a little quieter, simpler and closer to nature.  And now that I work remotely as a software developer, I don't necessarily need to live here for my job.   But I have a hard time picturing my life without the amazing independence that NYC affords.  In this city, I very rarely feel limited by my vision.I'm interested to hear from anyone who knows NYC well as a blind or visually impaired person, has experienced the advantages for mobility and freedom that it offers, but now lives elsewhere. If you're out there, what prompted you to move? Where do you live now? And what was it like adapting to life outside the Big Apple?  While I'm happy to hear from anyone around the globe, I'm particularly interested in experiences within the US. I've traveled a good deal and know that places like London, Paris, Tokyo would be easy alternatives. \n",

      "Proprio - Backpack for visually impaired people / individuals who want to 'blind-locate' items in their backpacks Hi everyone,I am an aspiring industrial design student and I am designing an ergonomic backpack that I hope will be useful for the visually impaired. I am very surprised that such a product does not exist yet. Online research lead me to this subreddit and I have already learnt a lot so thank you. I would greatly appreciate your opinion and advice on some features that I think might be useful.1. Easy-access front external pockets with zips.2. External white cane pocket (left hand side)3. External elastic key holder (right hand side)4. Internal pockets with zips.5. Internal document holder with different textured walls for easy differentiation 6. All zipper pulls will be different shapes for easy differentiation7. Pen holder on shoulder straps If you have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Thank you again. Your advice is greatly appreciatedEDIT:Ive been told by blind students and teachers and parham90 that they would not want to be conspicuous by using a 'special backpack'. I understand their concern to be differentiated and want to clarify that the design of the backpack will not be conspicuous. I should have been clearer in the original post that it will be for everyone. I originally thought of this product for me because I like having my things seperated and organized in my backpack. Then a friend mentioned that blind people might find it useful so I have been trying to get in touch with more blind people to get tips. \n",

      "Twitter client for iOS (7 and 8) that supports auto-loading new tweets? (I'm posting this for a blind acquaintance who asked this question. Thank you all for your answers)Does anyone know of an accessible twitter client for iOS (7 and 8) thatsupports autoloading new tweets? I actually can check my timeline onlyseveral times a week but am following a whole bunch of people that reallyinterest me, so I don't want to miss anything. Besides, clicking this\"autoload more tweets\" button isn't really fun. The thing that disturbs mewith the native twitter app is that you can often find gaps in yourtimeline, meaning that many tweets don't load at all. Twitterific isannoying in the way that the \"read more\" hint is only given after you read acomplete tweet, so you constantly have to remember certain tweets.I actually think that every twitter client has more or less drawbacks, as Ialready tried tweetlist and echophone as well.I actually would like a twitter client offering the following:- easy-to-use interface- usage of several twitter accounts- favoriting, replying to tweets, sending tweets by email and checking out aperson's profile shouldbe reachable easily (like in twitterific)- automatically load more tweets without asking- unified timeline, like in twitterific, that shows tweets as well as directmessages and mentions- real muting of persons and hashtags (not like in twitterific where thetweets are still read to you)- of course, really good accessibility with VoiceOver- support of instapaper (especially well implemented in the standard twitterapp)- integrated browser with cleaner view of articles (like in twitterific)- loading a large number of tweets (very well done in tweetlist)- responsiveness (standard twitter app can be sluggish sometimes)- easy way to check out activity stream (as far as I know, only possible inthe standard twitter app)- eventually push notifications- eventually support of listsDoes such an app exist at all? I already wrote to the developers oftwitterific and was told that they wouldn't change the position of the \"loadmore\" button, as their users preferred it the way it is. This one was muchbetter in previous versions.Any recommendation is appreciated. \n",

      "What do you guys think about the idea of artificial intelligence explaining visual information to us? So the title basically says it all. But I’ll explain a little chrther—There are some models that were previously behind closed doors which would allow the user to gain some level of information about an image. You could feed any photo to the ai and it could describe in detail anything about the image to the user. I’m thinking this could have huge implications in the real world with live video feedback, and possibly with screen readers as well. Imagine screen recognition from apple, but the most perfect form of it. Imagine opening up a program with no accessibility, and simply having an ai walk you through where to place your cursor to access each element, and describe in detail any question you could have. Or better yet, speaking with the ai and asking it to perform actions for you. I can imagine this being incredible in smart glasses, and really cool for video games. Asking the glasses to keep an eye out for bathrooms, asking it to look for sandwiches on the menu, or playing a video game and asking the ai to guide you around, etc. I think the implications for this tool is going to be far reaching for us, but I was curious what you guys thought. \n",

      "HOH/Deaf experience at music festivals and concerts Hey all! Hoping folks on the thread might be able to help me with a story I'm writing on what it's like to experience a concert or music festival as someone who is deaf or HOH. Lollapalooza in Chicago is this weekend, and they're among the big festivals that sometimes have ASL interpreters for popular artists. I'm talking to the fest organizers, the ASL interpreters and the HOH organizations about all this, but I really want to include the experience and perspective of someone who has actually gone to shows -- particularly ones where an ASL interpreter is present. I think there's a lot of misconceptions among people who aren't HOH about how -- or even *that* -- someone with a hearing disability can enjoy music. How do you like to enjoy music? How to ASL interpreters factor into that experience? I'd love to hear from you. Message me and we can trade emails/contact. Thanks! Kim - The Huffington Post  \n",

      "Well, played Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled on my brother's Ps4, and boy, what an experience! I'm thinking of getting back into gaming, so I decided to give this one a try for fun and to see how my limited vision could handle the improved graphics. This game is a remake of the original Crash Team racing, which came out in 1999, so graphics were...much simpler. I played the original constantly and did fairly well, because I could see where I was going.As you can imagine, graphics have improved quite a lot. Even though I can't really see the difference sometimes, I've heard things moving to HD, 4K, and 8K. Also, I think developers are trying to make things look more realistic. That's fine for someone with normal vision, but for those like me, I can see, but everything kind of blends together in my head, making it harder for me to read the menus and see where to go on the track. Regardless, I loved playing and would love to keep trying.Before I did this, I searched for detailed, descriptive walkthroughs and did my best to remember the visual information they provided, so shout out to their creators. \n",

Another story, I also would like to share that -- I wear CI, and I overheard some conversation and the girl said something like \"so expensive\" in a city train and she was few seats away from me. She was talking to some other lady and I kinda felt like a creep for understanding some words lol. To confirm this, I asked the lady if she said that and she said yes. It left me impressed at myself. Passive/accidental listening is just crazy.But yeah, I think my brain is slowly improving at understanding some words and such.

      "Guidance on Audio Descriptions Hey everyone, I've popped in here before a few times. I am a youtuber who does audio descriptions when I can. My last full game audio description was back in November and it was The Quarry, but it took me like 60 hours to put together so I figured that's an unreasonable content plan as someone who's working and has my hand in a lot of content creating cookie jars.  I've decided to start releasing smaller bits like maybe level by level on Mondays and/or audio description livestreams on Mondays. I started yesterday with Fire Emblem Engage, because it's new and I don't want anyone to miss out on the fun/discourse, and to be honest I feel like a lot of turn based games such as SRPGs and JRPGs could and should be easily more accessible (I'm trying to make my own jrpg for completely blind players but it's slow going and I'll definitely ask for some guidance on that down the line).&#x200B;My question is, for something like a live audio description, how would it be better to handle say a cutscene in a game? Would it be better to jam in a word or two during the action or wait until it's all over and summarize it? \n",

      "help books to be read without TTS from manufacturer Hello, I hope this is the right place to give this advice. Although I am not blind, I have a disability when it comes to reading. After reading a few words my mind just stops. But if something is read to me I'm ok. Now alot of these corporations that sell ebooks don't have text to speech enabled so that the blind can read the book, but I have found a solution and I hope this helps! Basically it is a program called NaturalReader, I beleive the latest version is 12. So if you want something read, whether it is protected in an image format, or in a cryptic protection, this program allows you to simply draw a rectangle around the text area, and then it automatically starts reading to you. You can also load image files to. The reason I prefer the rectangle method is because as I go through and ebook, I can just keep doing that when the pages are finished. Anyway I hope this contributes something, take care. \n",

      "Greetings fellow visually impaired folks. Just wanted to say hi to everyone and give my story.        I was born prematurely in January 1988, I was due in April. I had ROP and surgery to reattach both retinas. It was somewhat successful in my right eye and unsuccessful in my left. I have scar tissue on my retina which impairs my vision (20/80 when I was 18). I feel it's getting worse over the years but I'm glad just to be able to see as well as I can. I don't have insurance these days so it's expensive to get regular checkups, I already owe Vanderbilt a pretty good amount of money.         When I was 12 years old my left eye was being \"disposed of\" by my body. I don't know the medical term but fat was growing around my eye and they said it had to be removed or my body was going to remove it for me pretty much. If anyone knows more info about that phenomenon I'd be happy to hear about it.        I thought I'd share a funny story from my childhood. My uncle (we call him Buddy) has been blind roughly half his life. I don't know the exact age he was when we was blinded. He had an accident before I was born that caused him permanent brain damage and blindness. I'm told he can see light (similar to having your eyes closed I guess) but nothing else. He's really adjusted to it and able to tell different denominations of money (which I find really amazing) and play the drums (also cool, he taught me some when I was young).         I don't want to get too off topic here so to get on to my story. I was probably four or five years old and had asked him what his cane was for. He told me it was to help him see. I picked up his cane and stuck it to my eye (like holding a telescope or something) and proclaimed \"I can't see anything\". My great grandmother and him thought that was the funniest thing ever. I always feel a bit embarrassed when I think back on it for being so naive.        Sorry for such a long winded first post, I never thought of looking up a subreddit for people similar to myself. I don't have anyone I can relate to when it comes to low vision.           \n",

If I mention doing anything socially she has a problem with that, not that it stops me. My sighted brother can do what he likes. She's always played  mind games and I'm not looking for advice on that aspect. I guess I just wanted to know if anyone has been through similar — living your life but having someone who really should love and support you and be happy for your independence be so the opposite. I even mentioned playing tennis and she just basically shot me down. I feel like a different person for each half of the week, and I'm not sure how much longer I can cope.

Hello everyone,I build affiliate websites and niche websites pretty much all the time, and recently have been talking with a client of mine who is visually impaired and the difficulties he can face trying to use tools, sites etc that aren't well designed with accessibility in mind.It really got me thinking about how I didn't really consider people who had trouble reading websites and those who used screen readers to browse and navigate the web.Now - of course I know there are web standards for this type of thing and I'm going to be digging deeply into them over the next couple of weeks, but I wanted to ask you guys and gals about more first hand issues and problems that you run into on a day to day basis and what you'd like people who produce websites to consider when building out sites to make *your* browsing easier and more enjoyable.I plan on writing a huge article about this, highlighting as many of the issues and problems that I'm sure are obvious to you, but might be overlooked by someone not relying on a high contrast setting, or on a screen reader.Any and all comments really will help me learn more about this, and will allow me to produce a genuinely useful and hopefully outstanding article for web developers to refer to in order to step up their game and make the web much more accessible.If you prefer to talk privately, feel free to shoot me a private message with your email address and I'll pick up the discussion via email!Thanks so much in advance,Steve \n",

      "I'm really struggling with the CI waiting time. Does anyone have any words of advice to help get me through this? I haven't posted in quite awhile! However, every time I post the community is amazing!For anyone who doesn't wanna creep my history- I'm a 19 year old female in Western Canada. I have always been deaf in my left ear, and hard of hearing in my right. My right ear's hearing fluctuates big time, always has. There has never been a determined cause for any of my hearing loss. I have worn a hearing aid in my right ear since grade 1. I was quite lucky and didn't have any real hearing problems until about grade 8, so my speech is that of a hearing person, if not better. I do not know an ounce of sign language. My first language is English, then French and German.So I applied to get a CI for my left ear in October of 2014. There was one hearing test they needed to do to complete my CI assessment, and they couldn't get me in for that until early February 2015. Therefore, when they calculate the wait list times for me, I am expected to get my surgery 14 months from February 10, 2015. So about April 10, 2016. My surgeon is amazing and he has placed me on the pediatric list, which is far shorter, as well as the cancellation list. He told me in about January that I should only be waiting about 1-3 months to get in for surgery. But its been about that long and still nothing. My mom called the surgery office today and they said that I still have about a year before I can really start bitching about it basically. It's really getting at me that I can't know if I'm #4 on the list, or #28.So here's my problem- I haven't worked since late September. I live at home with a well off family who doesn't charge me for rent or anything; so day to day, I really don't worry about money at all. But I want to go to school for nursing, and I only have maybe 4 grand saved up for the 12 grand program. I really need to start working.However, I wanted to go to school for nursing in September 2014 already, but with talk about getting a CI, that was off the my list of options. So I figured I could go to school September 2015. Nope, on the waiting list for surgery now, that's not an option. I really, REALLY, **REALLY** need to go to school for September 2016, but I'm concerned I won't have enough money for it because I've been sitting around doing nothing because I'm deaf and the bloody waiting list is 14 months long.  I have to have my application in by early February 2016 and I'm panicking so bad that I won't know about my surgery date at that point. I can't put down all the savings I have for a school I may not be able to attend that year.I live in a small city, in a farming province (AKA there are no major cities in this province. Heck, the nearest Olive Garden is 9 hours away). I've contacted a deaf services place here, and they haven't found me employment. I tried a disabilities program, they haven't found me employment. All I've been doing is volunteering with local animal rescues and conservation programs. I really do love it, but it's not bringing in any money of course.My hearing in my right ear has been really good the last month or two, I feel like in the right employment setting, I could work. However, I've tried many times, but no employer wants to hire someone who may have to quit the first week because their hearing vanished overnight (its happened to me before!) I'm looking into casually babysitting because it's way more temporary. The reason I haven't babysat more is because I feel like it's a safety issue if I can't hear the baby in the next room, or the fire alarm. On top of that, it's been extremely difficult to watch my guy friends finish trade school and start working, and seeing my girlfriends finish their second and third years of university. It's so hard to see everyone moving on, and I'm just sitting here with my life on hold.I'm going to talk to my surgeon sometime this month and see if there's any way I can get bumped up, or by the sheer grace of God, get transferred to a different province (extremely slim chance, but I'll cross my fingers). Likely nothing will come of this, but who knows.I have a plan, I know exactly what I want to do with my life, but I can't do it until this surgery is out of the way, and this surgery could be over a year away from *today*. Does anyone have any tips on waiting? I can't work, I can't go to school, I don't want to get married until I finish school. I feel like my entire life is on hold because I can't get in for a single 2 hour surgery. If anyone can give me some advice, or just words to help me through this it'd be really appreciated!TL;DR: waiting list for CI surgery is 14 months long. I can't work, go to school, or get married until the surgery is done. I'm really struggling with having my life on hold and watching my high school class of 300 all do great things while I just sit here. I have a plan, I know exactly what I want to do in life, and it kills me that I can't do an ounce of it. Does anyone have any advice to help me through this? \n",

      "My friends and I are designing a device to help seeing impaired persons read more easily. As the title states, my friends and I are doing something related to helping seeing impaired people read normal text that is not available via recording/pdf and not available in braille.  We are all computer engineering students so this will be somewhere in that realm. Our idea at the moment is some device that you can slide over english/whatever text to capture and translate into braille via rising braille cells (think a single line of mechanical, changeable braille text).  My friends and I don't know anyone who would need such a thing, so I come to this sub to hopefully get some feedback.  Mostly, is this something that may be helpful?  If you are blind, or know someone who is seeing impaired, are you aware if there is a struggle to read things not very available in terms of other readings?  Or maybe you've found most things are available online or by recording rather easily?  Also, any ideas on the form factor of such a device would be nice.

A RITC in the right (for moderate to severe loss).I have tried a ridiculous number of audio products and accessories over the years to try and get a good 'headset' experience when listening to music, or gaming.The following configuration seems to work best for me:* I put the left (BTE) HA in telecoil mode.  This seems to work well with all headphones I've tried - as good as with hearing hooks - and it gives me enough audio in the left ear to provide a sense of direction in games. (Ie. if someone is speaking on my left, I can tell that's where they are located.)* I make no adjustments at all to the right (RITC) HA.  The headset earpiece covers it and it works just great.However, while most devices output a good (loud) level of audio to the headset, others don't.  Even at full volume, there are two devices in particular that have me squinting trying to hear what's been said: My TV, and my PS4.If anyone knows of a relatively inexpensive amplification solution, I would be very grateful.  Thank you. \n",

      "Braille Music Notator - a free online utility Hi, r/blind! I wanted to share something I've been working on for seven or eight months now. It's Braille Music Notator, an online utility for creating braille music scores. know there are utilities out there that translate music files from programs like Finale and Sibelius into braille music notation, but the resulting scores often leave something to be desired as far as legibility, efficiency and elegance.So my utility takes a different approach: you build the entire score in braille music notation, but the braille characters are translated for you into musical symbols. The score can be saved to your computer as a file which can be opened and edited later in the utility, or it can be exported as a BRF file and sent to an embosser or notetaker or what have you.The utility is designed primarily for sighted users, with the goal of making braille music more accessible to them for the benefit of their visually impaired students. But it's also completely accessible with a screen reader and keyboard using the WAI-ARIA \"application\" object.It's still in alpha (I still have a few features I'd like to add) but it's very usable — I have a student who has been using it quite a bit — and I'd love to get some more feedback. Let me know what you think. Thanks! \n",

      "What is the best online lip reading course? So I'm not deaf but I am a little hard of hearing. I find it especially difficult when there's lots of background noise - like at a train station, bar etc.I think it would be very useful if I could lip read a bit. Is an online course the best way to learn? And if so is there one you've used that's been particularly good? (or particularly bad).Obviously I've googled this but it's hard to know what's good content, what's not, and how much one should be paying for it.Any other advice on lip reading, such as book recommendations etc., would be greatly appreciated, thank you! \n",

      "Having vision problems, struggling to work and to play, super overwhelmed. What kind of work can I do? Hobbies? Helpers? Need advice and encouragement. I am not losing my vision, with glasses I can drive and function just fine. But using my eyes, especially with a screen, causes severe eye strain and neurological stress, brain fog, chronic fatigue, the works. I'm currently struggling with working even part time. I've gotten accommodations somehow for about a year to figure things out. Even though I love my job and would like to salvage the situation rather than find a different job, I am willing to consider looking into a different job. I just don't know how that would work or where to look, or if I can even 'qualify' or if I would have serious difficulty considering I don't 'technically' have disability status.I have considered disability but honesty it terrifies me, I know it takes forever, I know it is extremely difficult to get approved, and I fear the best it will ever offer me is the ability to not have to work for less than poverty. I have not heard great stories. I still don't quite understand what accomodations a workplace is supposed to offer that could help me. I've done loads of treatments and diagnosis, it does seem to stem from something neurological. At this point have some exercises to do at home but they are almost impossible to do myself (for other reasons, something like ADHD) without some kind of *in-home* or *always-accessible* occupational therapist, or mentor, just someone to do it with or somewhere to do it at least multiple times a week. I cannot find anyone to help me in the way I need, and I do not know where to look any more. But even at home, I'm struggling to find hobbies or how to function with everyday tasks.All I really want at this point is to find some recovery, to fix things before I have to resign myself to a life somehow without using my eyes ever again. In the meantime, I'm happily willing to try to find ways to rest and accommodate, but that's presenting to be difficult as well.And in general, I'm just not good at this kind of problem solving. I need someone to talk things through and figure out my situation, needs, obstacles, options, make a decision, and to help me follow through. This is obviously not normal or functional, but it's what I've got to work with, and it's the kind of help I have struggled the absolute most to find. Think of it as low Practical Intelligence.The issue at hand is this:With work, a career, or just trying to enjoy myself; everything I've ever wanted to do or been involved in involves sight, and honestly it would take several specialist doctors telling me I just can't do a job that requires vision ever again to give up on it. I have sensory issues with my ears on top of that, it seems, because I can't stand listening to audiobooks or even music for very long. That can't replace every hobby I've ever loved.As an aside, I have loved studying about blindness, braille, and disabilities/disabled languages long before I started having issues. But I still don't understand how you're supposed to navigate things without looking at the thing or looking at a screen. How can *anything* be intuitive or feasible at scale or *enjoyable* when you only have linear, dictated, one-line-at-a-time visibility and input? Does that make sense? It's like playing video games with a command line in my mind.I get the *concept* of a screen reader but I don't know how you would learn that. Like for example; it makes some sense an audio engineer might be able to be a good job for a visually impaired person... except every audio engineering device or software I've ever seen is graphically oriented. Even a job like I do, mostly design and database interaction, is very heavily *looking at a screen* and I can't imagine how I could do that without that. At least not efficiently.Regardless, I don't think I can learn that on my own. I want someone to *show* me. I'm overwhelmed and depressed, chronically tired, my brain doesn't work to well when things are bad and I still need to do the thing, and I really struggle to just try things or put myself out there especially with something I'm unfamiliar with.So I guess I have more of a story dump than a specific question. But I could really use some helpful advice, especially for someone who, with reasons related or otherwise, struggles to *DO* things for themselves.- If I am to find another job, even temporarily, what kind of job could I possibly do? How could I get help in the transition?- What kind of things can I do at home? I NEED a creative outlet and a consumptive inlet; a life of crochet sounds like literal torture. I want to draw, I want to design and play board games, I want to play video games, I want to watch and create videos. I want to somehow consume uhealthy amounts of manga and comics. But all of these things hurt me. And I don't have the mental stamina to do much creative/mentally taxing work to boot.- Is there anyone, anywhere who can *physically* help me adapt my circumstances to a more visually impaired accessible form? Am I not disqualified from that? How do I navigate that??- Where do I get help when everything I can find seems designed to be impossible for me to do, and intentionally expensive, obfuscated, complex, and obstructive in providing me services at every stage? I need an advocate.- Lastly, where can I find some reliable community, guidance, mentorship, just plain friendship and advice? This is so isolating it's maddening. I imagine that experience is not unique to me.Thanks for listening. \n",

      "How do I adjust to gaining vision Hello everyone. I know my “problem” is quite uncommon and I know that I am extremely lucky to have had this opportunity, and I am forever grateful for it.I have been legally blind since birth but I have always been able to see a little. My eyesight had gradually deteriorated over time, but not that I’ve noticed and I had been able to adjust slowly. One morning this summer, I woke up and my eyesight had become much worse over night. It was a lot to get used to and it made me sad.Long story short - I had my lense replaced with an artificial one two weeks ago and I suddenly got much better eyesight. I am still visually impaired and will always be, but I have more useful vision now than before.This has also been a lot to get used to. I have vague memories of being able to see this much when I was little, but there is a big difference between being 4 and 19. It feels so weird to be able to read signs on shops, read large print and to be able to see what my friends and teachers look like. Today, I tried to walk on campus without my cane, something I had not done for over three years. It felt like I had forgotten something important like my phone or keys. And what do I do with my right arm? And where do you look when you talk to someone? I don’t want to be rude and look away but at the same time not stare at the person I’m talking to in a weird way.Even though all assistive tech and gear are useful, how do I let go of some of them without feeling unsure?I’m really happy and clueless at the same time. If you have any advice for someone who has gained their vision, please give it to me!Thank you very much! \n",

      "Deaf customer comes into my print shop. How can I help transactions go smoother? Hello all!I'm not familiar with this sub or deaf culture in general I'm afraid to say. I live in a rural area so I just do not have any interaction with people who may be hearing impaired. However, I work at a local print shop in a village and I have one customer who comes in relatively often to get some copies made. I obviously have not talked with him at length but it is clear that he has no hearing at all. When it comes to making copies and getting prints it takes us a while to get what he needs done and I'm upset that I cannot communicate with him better.I thought I'd stop in here to see if anyone has any advice or suggestions for me that I could utilize to help his visit to the print shop go a bit smoother. He seems very nice but he always seems rushed and generally frustrated that he has to come in so I feel bad that I can't just get him want he needs quickly and effectively. I also feel kind of useless and ignorant because I don't know the proper way to get his attention or tell him \"hold on a second\" or communicate \"okay\" and \"thank you\" and simple things like that. I don't want to seem rude by doing general like thumbs up hand gestures but I want him to know I'm engaging him and not just doing whatever and ignoring him because he cannot hear.A little information that I have gathered about him. He either does not or cannot lip read as he, I think purposefully, does not look at my face often. He has not tried to sign so I do not know if he can or is willing to, my print shop is in a small town so it is unlikely there are many who can sign anyway so he may just assume that nobody has the ability to. He is older and also cannot verbally speak at all, I know this because he will occasionally want to get my attention but he just makes basic grunts to do so.I hand him a notepad and a pen every time he comes in after he motioned for one the first time, unfortunately he doesn't have great penmanship and writes as little as possible so it doesn't help much besides giving me an idea of what direction we need to go in.He gets black and white copies usually of article and posters. Usually it isn't a straight forward \"2 copies\" order because he will want it on a specific size or one item multiple times on a sheet. He comes over to the printer with me and basically, instead of communicating, tries to make the copies by himself. This isn't a huge problem generally because I don't mind him in the back with me while I make the prints (I'm sure he doesn't know how to write out what he wants) but our machines are not simple (we are not like a kinkos, we're an actual large run printing place which also is wiling to do small copies for the community) so we end up kind of fumbling over each other while he tries to do what he needs and I try to help him because he doesn't understand how the machine works.So I know this may be a lot of unnecessary thought and information. I hope this doesn't seem rude or insignificant. I'm sure this isn't a big deal for this man, in a small town he can't have a very easy time getting what he wants done so its probably very common for him. However, since I'm completely ignorant on this subject, I thought it was worth asking if you guys had an suggestions. Are there any general things I should be doing to help? Are there acceptable gestures to give him for things like \"Thank you\" or \"Just a second\" or \"How many?\" without being rude?Thanks in advance for any help! \n",

      "College Application Statement- Need Advice on How it Sounds I made a post 5 days ago about my college application statement.  finally got around to writing my statement. I know its a bit raw but I think I did a solid job. Keep in mind Im trying to use this to convince them Im a good candidate for College Admission. Just to tie a ribbon on the application, I guess.Here it is:I was diagnosed with a severe hearing loss in both ears when I was 6 years old. I hadn't experienced the world properly-- I didn't understand communication with others and had a hard time connecting with others. I also missed out on some of the basic human experiences such as listening to music or nature. When I was fitted with my first pair of hearing aids, the world changed drastically. I could understand the complexity of music, the serenity of nature, and the joy of connecting with my peers. Hearing aids changed the way I viewed the word. Naturally, I was drawn to learning about this aspect of my life.What I experienced when first using hearing aids was truly astounding. I've lead a somewhat normal life despite having a severe disability. Knowing this has always drawn me to help people experience the world with proper hearing-- specifically young children. Aiding in the testing of hearing and the fitting of hearing aids is something that I want to be part of.Through some online research, I am aware that this school offers an Audiology program. I feel like I would be a great fit with the audiology program in the future because of my experience with hearing loss and my yearning to aid, teach, and connect with others regarding their hearing disability.I'd appreciate any feedback on it. What are your initial thoughts? Do I sound awkward, cocky, off topic at all? I need to make sure Im eloquent.Thanks for the help guys. \n",

      "Eye treatment experiences regarding CNV. I'm 35 with low vision. Ideally I'd like to keep the vision I have, but that hasn't really been working out as intended. I have degenerative myopia with choroidal neovascularization. For about two years I've been receiving Avastin injections. Last year I had a reoccurrence about 5 months after my prior injection. As a result I was placed on shorter intervals, spacing them out further and further to find the sweet spot. I've been getting them between 8-12 weeks for a bit. I had bilateral bleeds 62days post injection. Based on what I've found online, anti-vegf agents stay in the system for over 3 months, so I'm particularly concerned about the short interval. I will be seeing my retina doctor on the 20th. I'm interested in learning about any treatments you guys may have received, and possible alternatives that you turned to if injections didn't work. Experience with AMD is pretty similar, so anyone who had treatments for that, I'd love your ideas too! Basically anyone with CNV. Any insights appreciated! Thank you! \n",

      "Fainting at certain pitches? Hi! I just found this subreddit today, and I'm so thrilled.First off, I'd like to introduce myself as deaf (or hearing impaired, either works). I've got moderate to severe loss in one ear, and severe to profound in the other. I have BtE hearing aids for both, and I'm known as a \"gain junkie\" to my audiologist, which is someone who wants/needs the loudest volume she can get.With that said... I'm also a musician. I got into a school of music with my flute and have performed quite a bit. However, I've found that if I remain on certain notes for too, it causes me to faint. (Literally had to sit at a recital rather than standing because my warm-up note got too much in the music hall.) If anyone's curious, I can give you the notes that causes this reaction. I can tell you it's in the G5-A5 range (on a piano, you should be able to look those up and hear what it sounds like), and those frequencies are about 739.99 - 880.00. It's definitely a higher pitch. It only started when I got these Arriva X Audifon hearing aids back in 2010-2011 (after switching from a very old hearing aid model). I was 17-18 then, and I'm 22 now.Does anyone else have this problem?? I've tried telling others, but they're all hearing and have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm hoping that maybe someone's had something similar here...**Edit: (Sorry for the multiple edits, just keep having to add more things for clarification.) I used \"fainting\" loosely and should have said that I get extreme vertigo, hence the not being able to stay upright whenever this happens.**Edit: The pitches aren't restricted just to my flute. It's basically anything that makes noise at that pitch that bothers me. Crowds cheering, piano, music, etc.. (That's why I'd jokingly say that crowds seem to generally cheer in \"this\" note, hah.)Edit: I didn't think there was a connection, but my vision tends to go wacky whenever there's a loud noise like truck engines and such. /u/audiodoc brought up SSCD, which sounds like a good explanation for any/all of this? If anyone else has anymore ideas, feel free to say. I may see about looking into SSCD and getting tests done if I can.tldr; Apparently it's uncommon to be affected by loud noises/pitches. /sadface \n",

Are languages very country-specific, or could I find a sign language more universal like spoken English is to the world?Edit:I just found out Danish Sign Language only got recognized as a true language by our government less than a year ago.

I've been looking into CC's I can implement for my love streams, but as you all know that technology is still in its infancy and the results are abysmal 🤦‍♀️ Through my own need for aides I came across this app [ and I realised there were probably some other apps I can install and keep active while I stream in order to offer greater accessibility, but I'm an Android-user and I am hearing so I have no idea which apps that would be useful to the HoH/deaf community.Do any of you have any suggestions? I'm just a small streamer doing it for fun, and I never expect to \"make it\" as a streamer, but I still want to be inclusive. I did reach out to a small HoH/deaf-community here in Norway, but since I stream in English (UK - I know that affects the choice of transcribers) and they mainly use apps aimed at Norwegian they suggested I looked here instead.I don't have a lot of money, so I know I can't invest in anything extravagant, but if I can afford it I will purchase any good recommendation - and if I can't, then I will try to save up for it, be it program or app.Thanks in advance, and sorry for invading your space! \n",

Hi everyone, I am using a throwaway because I would like to remain anonymous, but I've been lurking for a long time because I like to stay on top of things for the visually impaired on behalf of my son.My son is visually impaired (legally blind and wears thick glasses) and I bought a groupon for him to try out taekwondo to help improve his confidence and discipline among other things. I took him in today for the initial meeting with the master (or whatever they call them). He kept looking at my son and saying things like \"well, because he is not normal, I can't put him in the regular class\". He referred to my son as \"not being normal\" a few times throughout the conversation all the while my son was sitting there right next to me. I took my son home (because I didn't want him to hear what I was about to say) and went back to ask the man to clarify the statements he made. He said that my son has \"thick glasses and looks weak\". This is a true statement, my son is thin and wears thick glasses. I couldn't believe that he would say this, but I guess some people are completely ignorant. I need help. My son is 5 and I know we will face things like this for the rest of our lives, but I am more than livid and I just can't believe this happened. He didn't even give my son a chance to try any activities, prior to passing judgment. Sorry for the rant everyone, I'd love any thoughts on how to deal with situations like these. Thanks. \n",

      "New Pocket Watch for the Blind I've been hunting for a suitable pocket watch for my blind father for ages, but the ones with exposed hour and minute hands seem to break far too easily, and the talking ones aren't appropriate for when he's up and about either very late evening or very early morning.As it turns out, Alexandravision (a Swiss company), has developed and created a vibrating pocket watch (the Meteor) that is not only dead simple to use, but has proven so far to be robust enough to withstand a good number of drops and bumps and keep working flawlessly! It's about 3 inches long, 1.5 inches wide, and 0.75 inches thick, shaped roughly like a teardrop with a scalloped side for your thumb that holds three buttons (hours, tens of minutes, and single minutes). $100+ they're not the lowest cost item out there, but a great alternative to the other types! Since it took me so long to stumble across these I figured I'd try and pass the find along! \n",

      "Looking for advice for a webcomic transcription Hello, r/blind!I write a webcomic and there is a \"transcript\" option on the program I use to post my pages. I've been thinking of adding transcripts to the comics, but I'm not quite sure what would be most useful.Now, I don't know if any of you would even have any interest in reading my comic specifically or webcomics in general. But I think you're probably the most qualified to tell what to include or not to include.I realise I should describe what is happening in each panel, on top of writing out all the dialogue. What I don't know is how specific I should be. Should I describe the characters? If so, in how much detail? Height, race, the clothes they wear? Is most of it unnecessary detail, or does it help setting the scene?I mean, if pages down the line a character cleans his glasses, it will help if I mentioned that he wears glasses when he's introduced. If someone's race, age, height, or otherwise appearance comes into play, it will be good to have it described beforehand. But I'll be honest: I don't know exactly all the details of what may or may not become a plot point in 100 pages. Should I describe it as much as I would to someone was I reading the comic to them (I would describe absolutely everything) or just give a really quick list of what's being said and done? Or something in the middle?What would you personally prefer? What would make you want to come back for more? What would make you want not to read any further?Thanks for your input, guys. I would really like to add transcripts but I don't want to do a half-assed job. \n",

      "Advice on bone anchored hearing implant Sorry if this isn't the right place, since I only have single sided deafness. I haven't been able to hear out of one ear for about 13 years and until recently I couldn't afford to do much about it in the way of implants. I see my audiologist every few years and the last time I was in he told me about the new BAHA implant that attaches via a subdermal magnet. He said he has never done one on someone who has had single sided deafness as long as me (usually 1-3 years), but that he is fairly confident that my brain can still \"rewire\" and use it effectively. I am just looking to hear from anyone who has gone this route to see if it works well, is comfortable, or if they would do it again. Any help would be very appreciated! Thanks \n",

      "Fighting Job Discrimination (US Version, by a CODA) I'm a CODA, not deaf or HoH, so you can take this with a heaping tablespoon of salt.Be up-front and blunt about your deaf/HoH-ness, it saves time and BS. Also if you can afford it, get an interpreter YOU trust for peace of mind that the channels of communication aren't muddied.If you live in the United States, under title one (I) of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) of 1990, an employer cannot discriminate against you due to you being deaf/HoH in any part of the hiring process, nor fire you if hired because of it. They must provide you with reasonable accommodations in the hiring process and on the job. Their webpage is:  you feel you have been discriminated due to your deaf/HoH-ness, you can file a complaint with the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission)Their website tells you how, where, and how much time you have to file, and the many ways you can do so.Their website is:  practice however, this usually does not work, as the employer can say, \"I didn't hire him/her because I found someone more qualified\" (Yeah, someone not deaf, I know because this happened to my dad frequently).The burden of proof falls on you to prove the allegations of discrimination, so keep detailed documentation of each job application and their hiring/interview process. (Even if you can't hear, use a voice recorder at interviews, most phones nowadays have one and are silent when in use. Along with paper and detailed electronic logs, recordings are your best friends at a trial/hearing (not trying to be a jerk).)If you get hired, keep detailed notes of any discrimination by your co-workers/bosses, like say, they make fun of you, they're pointing at you and laughing, ignoring you, or being passed over for a promotion for someone less skilled due to being deaf/HoH. (You can do this via paper or electronic history, just remember to KEEP DETAILED RECORDS)Please do not take this as legal advice, as I am not a lawyer, but if you feel the need to, DO consult a lawyer, the above is a compilation of informational and anecdotal resources.Edit: Remember to request ADA accommodations IN WRITING to ensure your needs are met, and ensuring you have the higher ground in any litigation. Also a vital part  of detailed recordkeeping. (Thanks /u/audiodoc!)Edit 2: Some helpful links from /u/DuncantheWonderDog: of reasonable accommodations from the National Association for the Deaf) of Deaf/HoH people and accommodations in the workplace, also gives brief overview of the ADA (from the EEOC) covering information in first two links, but still good, can be used as a printout along with ADA accommodations request)Edit 3: Not all states allow for recording without the other party's consent (two party consent), check your state's laws before doing so.

Hi everyone,We are Alberto Rizzoli and Marita Cheng from Ray Kurzweil's Singularity University.

      "A discussion about accessibility equipment cost. A few questions and some thought on current technology. I've recently saw an article highlighting the ASL translator at Ars Technica and have a few concerns that I would like to discuss about. product seems to be just a window 8 tablet coupled with a leap motion device. Would the program be ported so it can work on any computer with a leap motion device? If not, I'm curious as what is preventing that. I do see a mention of the company considering android OS. But that is no indication of allowing us to purchase just the leap motion itself for our existing computer or tablet.The main reason I'm asking is the concern about cost. It seems far more feasible and practical to at least also offer the option for the average customers buy the leap motion separately and use it with the program on a tablet or a laptop that they may already have. $80 leap motion vs $800 unnecessarily over-specialized equipment. I am not seeing any mention of this possibility in any other articles that I am reading about this equipment. Based on their site, this tech uses the [Dell Venue 8 Pro which are only about $280]( and a [leap motion sensor for only $80]( (I do like the monthly payment plan though, we need some way to support the ASL dictionary and app itself).I am concerned about the trend I have seen with accessibility equipment in that many devices are very expensive, requiring assistance to obtain them. While at the same time, the fundamental concept behind these equipment can be easily replicated on any common technological platform. For example, this came out  when netbooks was also coming out too. It is far cheaper (and possibly far more profitable) to release a custom software to be used on any linux or windows netbook than it is to buy the ubiduo equipment at around $2000. At the time, it was possible to buy an eeePC 900 for about $200-300 each. Even if the software alone cost $100-200, that would still be far cheaper and FAR more usable than purchasing the ubiduo itself directly. (I actually brought this up with the owner of the company back in Denver quite a few years ago and he was extremely defensive. He couldn't give me any particular reason why the ubiduo was a better option than what I described other than perhap the improved durability). As of today, it is now cheaper to buy a cheap android phone (if you already have an android phone of your own) install an app such as this one,  for essentially the same functionality with much better portability.I am seeing similar equipment being marked up badly and it is annoying when these companies claim that it is all for helping us all. If it is truly for helping us all, then it will still be easy enough for the company to profit without gouging the businesses's cost and the people's wallet.I don't know. It just bothers me when I see these equipment meant to help people being sold at such a high cost that the people, that these equipment are meant for, cannot get it unless it is through an assistive program such as VR or only businesses can purchases it. \n",

      "DIY accessibility projects? Main focus on tactile options for deaf-blind. Hello, everyone. I'm deaf. I can see somewhat well but my vision have steadily gotten worse every single years and I am concerned that it will lead to legal blindness in a few years at the soonest. I am also now working at a deaf school where I assist frequently a deaf-blind student and interact with quite a few individuals who have low or nonexistent vision.I am pretty much disgusted at the prices of virtually all accessibility tools but particularly thing like the braille display. Being deaf mean that I would not be able to take advantage of the many accessibility tools I've seen that uses sounds. I can hear but my speech comprehension via hearing is extremely low So tactile is basically my only option if and when I do go blind. And the only tactile options I could find for interacting via the digital mean are very expensive.I am hoping to see if anybody here knows of any open sourced designs of any braille displays so I can try my hand at making a few? I am hoping to contribute and make enough to share with a few individuals I have in mind. I'm just not sure where to start because all I can really find are articles talking about how helpful this or that group is being with reinventing the braille displays and yet there was no source of information that I can actually take advantage of for building one of my own.I am hoping to maybe figure out a design using a raspberry pi zero with a bluetooth adapter to be able to hook up the braille display with any android phones. But I'll need to find a place to start from.Anyway, I'm hoping to better equip myself for the possible chance of me going blind and use the same knowledge to at least better understand and help the other blind people that I works with.Thank you. \n",

What hardware specs should he look for, other than being able to run Windows 10?  Is there a brand of computer he should consider over any other?

      "Where are you on the “other senses” debate? I’ve been legally blind for over half my life and am now “profoundly” blind, but I still focus very much on what I can see because I find that little bit of visual input to be overall more useful to me than my other senses (for the most part.) If my audio processing has improved, it’s mainly just in the area of being able to hear audiobooks at a much faster rate tha my friends. If it’s windy out and the waves are pumping, I can’t really hear to cross the road very safely. I almost can never hear bikes coming until they are within an unsafe distance from me. I wouldn’t say that my hearing has improved. The hardware of my ear is the same as everyone else’s after all.I have to think about what I hear more often, but I can’t really “hear better” like some people expect. I can hear pressure changes when I pass, say, an open doorway, but that was true even when my sight was good as a child.The other day, someone said about my blind mother “She must have a good sense of smell.” That’s ludicrous. She lost her sense of smell to sinus medication a couple decades ago and going blind didn’t make it magically come back. Also, some blindness conditions come with hearing loss (Usher’s for instance). I’d say my greatest talent is taking extremely distorted and limited vision and making it usable for myself.How do you feel when people tell you that “all your other senses make up for your blindness”? Do you feel that’s true? \n",

      "Does anyone play board games suited for the visually impaired? I've heard of braille and large print playing cards, dice and dominoes.  But not of chess or Monopoly being done in large print and braille, until recently.  Unfortunately not so much for more modern board games it would seem.I was thinking this morning and then confirmed it in one of the links, that different shaped tokens can help a lot, when playing a game if visually impaired.  At least you'd know what shaped token would belong where and what it represents in general by quick touch.  Then you'd just need to have braille and maybe make the colors more bright and numbers bigger.Not sure how chess would be played unless you were to continually roam your hands over the board to remember where each piece was or an open space or what was just moved.  I can not even play chess and I am not visually impaired.  Also not sure how you would not knock over the game pieces when trying to measure each and every piece and open area.  I have heard there are recesses in the board, but I'd assume you'd still need a light touch. If you were making or suggesting features to be more visually impaired friendly for a more modern board game, what would they be?  Thank you.Below are a few links for visual impaired players. \n",

(And why)Plus what kind of adaptations have you made to enjoy a sport/device to do sports?I'm doing my assessment ans challenges for eyes.But can't help to think there have to be some sports that are more challenging for ears...I went to a regular sighted school.I was usually the last one to be picked in any ball group game. Just like the other few kids with thick glasses.It was really difficult to play with any of the smaller ball games, especially if the ball was flying in the air. Baseball was a pure nightmare.Soccer at least you could hear better.I always havw loved swimming, and now giggle at the memories of walking to the wrong gender's shower rooms. I couldn't see any of the signs, but could of course at some point figure out how to make sure you get to the correct gender's shower rooms (wear glasses, or follow someone of your own gender, or always use the same swimming pool so you know where everything is). Of course also trying to learn how to do the swimming movements was really hard when you canʻt see what the teacher is doing.I guess those would have been the like-hate extremes.My current sports love affair is with running.Always the same routes (so I know where I am, and where all thr dangerous bits on the ground are). Always music or audiobooks so I can track my time and have my own world when I run.Or when running for a competition etc I'll need to figure out a bit more in advance how the logistics will work.

How to run safely and not into things, fall into things, or have people run into you) - I don't mind. :)Nature (whenever possible)...

      "Smartphone's for Visually Impaired - my iPhone input Hi all, I'm very glad I've found this subreddit, as it seems most forums on the web for the blind don't generate much conversation.  I'm legally blind, so I have some remaining vision left, but that is getting worse.  My post is specifically about smartphones for the visually impaired.  In terms of smartphones, I've only ever had an iPhone.  For me, inverted colors helps tremendously, so the Accessibility settings allow you to create a shortcut (triple push the home button quickly) to turn inverted colors on and off.  This makes looking at videos and pics easy when I can turn it on and off quickly.  On websites that allow you to use your fingers to zoom, reading text is great.  However, there are certain mobile sites and apps that do not allow zooming and it is damn near impossible to read them.  The iPhone does have a Zoom option where anything can be zoomed in, but I find it very clunky and difficult to use and navigate the screen.  I haven't updated to iOS 8 or iPhone 6 yet, but if/when I do, I'll be sure to post a review.  I'm curious if anyone has experience they can share with other smartphones, specifically for inverting colors and zooming on any website or app.  I'm wondering if there are any options out there aside from the iPhone that could work better.  Thanks, and let me know if there are any questions on iPhone accessibility.   \n",

      "i’m unsure how to write name signs. is there anything i should change about this passage? hi everyone! (i wasn’t exactly sure what flair to use. i’m hearing with questions, but specifically regarding a writing project.) i’m working on a historical fiction novel, and the protagonist’s little sister is deaf and communicates almost exclusively through LSF. i’m writing a scene where the protagonist introduces his little sister to his lover for christmas. it speaks on name signs, but although i’ve researched them, i just want to make sure i represent the experience accurately. here is the exchange in question:>”*Merry Christmas, Little Soldier*,” Pierre signed to her when they pulled apart. *Little Soldier*: a sign name that originated from her peers at the National Institute of Deaf-Mutes in lieu of spelling out all fourteen characters of her given name. Apparently, it was given on account of her passion for gunmanship, but Pierre held his own interpretation: She was, indeed, a little soldier in her own right. Having survived measles at such a young age, she was braver, Pierre thought, than he would ever be.>“*Merry Christmas! I missed you*.” She glanced at the young man standing by his side. “*Who is your friend?*”>“*This is G-A-B-R-I-E-L*,” he signed each individual letter, “*but I sometimes call him White Cat*.” The latter, likewise, was less tedious to sign. “*I met him through my studies.*”>Gabriel noticed the girl and subtly bowed his head. “Merry Christmas, mademoiselle.”>”Meet Jeanne-Baptiste.”>”Is she the one who…?”>“Cannot hear.”>For a moment, he seemed uncertain of how to proceed. Then, he waved with a smile, and she returned the gesture. “Will you tell her I say, ‘Merry Christmas’?”>Pierre passed on the message, moving his hands in a defined manner Gabriel wished to comprehend.>“*He seems nice*,” she replied.>“*Very.*” Pierre was stricken by a realisation: “*Last time we spoke, I was lodging alone. The White Cat is now my flatmate.*”>“*You chose to lodge with a flatmate instead of a mistress?*” she teased. “*Don’t worry. You’ll find one someday.*”>Pierre rolled his eyes and chuckled. Little did she know. But he could not let her in on their secret. It carried too much risk.>“What’d she say?”>“She said… ‘Merry Christmas.’”i definitely want this to be as accurate as possible, so i would greatly appreciate if you told me anything that needs change! thank you! \n",

      "Any ideas to make a first date/meet-up between deaf & hearing pair go spectacular? I've been texting with a very nice guy I met on one of the various dating sites. We seem to get along well and are going to meet up for coffee tomorrow afternoon. The only barrier is he's deaf while I'm not. We have discussed this some & basically agree that just trying it out, having to write/text while together (he says he's pretty miserable at reading lips) and just being patient will be fine. My question is- does anyone have any even little ideas on how to make this first actual meeting go great? Like I said, we've kind of discussed it, but any little tips that might not have come up would be great! Update- If anyone cares- we did finally have our date, it went great!

      "Feeling suddenly more skittish than usual: Members of the Proud Boys were strolling around my neighborhood with huge guns in sight, and I was suddenly yanked into a bar out of the street Yesterday morning, [the Holi-Drag Storytime for Children]( was cancelled due to security concerns: members of The Ohio Proud Boys (and other demonstrators) were planning to protest outside of the venue. There were armed people casually strolling around my otherwise pretty chill and fun neighborhood. I was dragged into a bar because someone wanted to make sure I was safe, but also I hate being touched and physically manhandled. I have a trauma-informed response when people touch me suddenly without my explicit consent, especially when I can't hear them approach or I'm focused on getting to my destination.Though I am grateful for the concern, I just wish that this didn't have to happen, and that we didn't live in the current divisive and violent political climate that we do now, and that I could simply turn off my brain so that I can actually leave my house. I wish that we could process these kinds of things in our own time and when it's most convenient. Definitely not late at night when you're trying to sleep or right before you're trying to run errands. Stay safe out there, everyone! Not sure why I am sharing this deeply unsettling experience with people on the internet. I suppose that if it were me, I would want to know that you can absolutely feel not okay while simultaneously feeling relief that there's one person out there who wasn't about to allow me to stroll around, completely oblivious to how close I was to an armed demonstrator. \n",

      "Visual art adapted for blind people: Is it appreciated? Hello everyone!I have a blindness-related question I have been asking myself for some time. I would be really curious to get the opinion of someone blind, and I really hope the question is not too naive or stupid.I've noticed very often how in museums or in certain touristic places there are tridimensional models of something visual for blind people. For example, I saw at least two relief-representations of church-facades placed in the square in front of the church itself. In museums there are often representations of some painting, so that blind people can actually touch it (an example is [here]( ). Now, maybe it's a stupid question, but I often ask myself if these things are actually appreciated by blind people or if it's a silly idea by people with sight. Maybe I got it all wrong, but I can't imagine how touching the tridimensional interpretation of the Mona Lisa could pass on an even remotely comparable sensation to the sight of the painting. I mean, it was conceived to be seen, why would it be as astonishing as something to touch? Or maybe touching it is a sufficient replacement? Or maybe touching the artwork isn't the same kind of experience, but nevertheless a different and equally satisfying experience? As I said, I would be very curious about the opinion of some people with limited sight: do you actually use those things? Are they enjoyable for you? Would you like to have them in more places or would you rather have different options provided to you?Because altogether the whole idea seems to me like something thought by someone who knows nothing about being blind. Instead of touching a model of a church (which I imagine a bit like looking at a music sheet for someone deaf), wouldn't it be cooler to have special hours where the place is very silent and the architecture is highlighted through clever sound effects or something like that?I look forward to your clarifications, thank you! \n",

      "I think I might be going blind. Or my vision is getting worse. I don't actually know or maybe im just paranoid So uh, i think I might be slowly going blind but  I do not think anyone would believe me due to the fact this also includes my family not believeing me as well.  My vision is like slowly getting blurrier and blurrier, but it flickers. My vision is flickering in a way, its getting blurrier and blurrier and i cant read text as much anymore. Even big text is getting a bit blurrier for me, if im close to it i can slightly read it. But even if i am close i can't see it as much though, I can see the colors but its still blurry. My vision is also like looking like its doubles, theres halos around rights and the light looks like the sun is reflecting into my eyes making it really bright and hurts. My eyes have been hurting a lot as well and like its kind of bad?. Also the flickering lights in my eyes suck but i have been having flickering lights in my vision since childhood black and white lights flickering in my vision, i don't get floaters often. But my vision is sometimes double too.. Very strange right?. I do not know what it is but my vision has been getting worse as i got older, I am not a adult though. I cannot see in the dark as well so I cling on to some things even if I know where i'm going, i just mainly go to the bathroom though. If I look at like something like my hand everything around it also goes blurry, I don't know if im just being like paranoid or not or if this even is normal eitherway. But am i just being paranoid? \n",

      "Sensorineural Hearing Loss (deaf/hard-of-hearing people) Hello!I'm 19 years old. I lost my hearing a month before my 14th birthday due to meningitis. I have bilateral sensorineural hearing loss; severe-to-profound hearing loss in one ear (basically 100% deaf) and moderate-to-severe hearing loss in the other ear. I also have tinnitus.Due to the fact that I lost my hearing in the midst of my life, I continued using English language, because that was what I was most accustomed to. I rely on both lip-reading and the little bit of hearing I have left in order to communicate.My hearing is quite difficult to explain. Even my family (who are around me 24/7) have a hard time understanding it! It's like some days I can't hear whatsoever and need endless repetitions until I finally understand what someone is saying; then others days, I won't even  be facing the person and I'll hear exactly what they said. So far, I've gathered that the more accustomed I am to hearing your voice, generally the easier it is for my brain to process what you're saying. My [immediate] family, on average, doesn't have to repeat themselves as much as people I don't know well.So that's my background! :) I'm here for two reasons. 1) I wanted to try and find people who might possibly relate to me and my situation, so we could connect and talk and get to know each other. I know hearing loss differs from person to person, but I wanted to tell my story just in case someone here also has hearing loss of similar circumstances. I've always wished to know more people who understand who I am/what I go through, so I hope to find people like that here.2) I need some advice!! I am currently without a hearing aid, because every audiologist I've gone to has told me it will be of little benefit, especially when compared to the cost of hearing aids. Again, I communicate by hearing AND lip-reading (I probably lip-read more than I listen). As some of you may know, audiology tests (at least the ones I've taken) do not allow you to read/see the audiologist's lips. They want you to repeat words back to them; and because half of my method of communicating was being withheld, I could not repeat any of the words I heard. So they did not recommend me hearing aids (instead they recommended cochlear implants, which I don't want).So for anyone with my particular type of hearing loss (sensorineural), can you tell me if you wear hearing aids and if they help any? I've googled some other answers and some people describe it as \"turning the volume up on a bad speaker\". Is that what wearing a hearing aid for SNHL is like? I could really use the help of knowing personal experiences. After having about 4 audiologists give me the same verdict, it is a little disheartening. I don't expect an aid to 100% fix my hearing, but it would be nice to not have to ask people to speak up all the time, or have background noise filtered out (as some aids do), and whatnot. Hearing loss is so complex, especially when it comes to certain frequencies/pitches that you're able to hear more than others, so I don't want to 100% rule out what could be a very beneficial thing for me to have, even if professionals disagree.Anyways, thanks for reading this long essay! I look forward to talking to some of you here. I've been trying to get involved in the deaf community, but never had any opportunity or any idea about where to start. Hopefully this will help. :) \n",

So I'm not sure if I'm posting this on the right subreddit, but I wanted to know if you help sign and share this petition.So I'm a hearing guy from El Salvador (a small country in central america) and on the last few years I've noticed how little our country tries to integrate Deaf people, it is extremely rare to find a school that accepts deaf kids or places that has any feature for Deaf people.Anyway, this petition is from a foundation that tries to help deaf people and teaches both ASL and Salvadoran Sign Language, and it ask national TV networks, cable companies and movie theatres to make close captioning available for free (since at least cable companies charge for them) and other places like banks and hospitals to implement measures so they become more accesible to Deaf people.I, and I think especially the Salvadoran Deaf Community would really appreciate if you signed and shared this petition.  \n",

      "Advice from guide dog users? Hello,So I've been consulting with a secondary orientation and mobility specialist about my current means of getting around.  I've been on a white cane since last September.  I have Leber's Congenital Amaurosis, and I've been having difficulty with it this past year.  I am a public transit commuter and have had some issues with safety on train platforms and at bus stops when I try to move quickly.  It is because of this that this O&M specialist asked if I had considered a guide dog.  I haven't up until this point and now I'm sort of just looking to gauge what it's like.  I am not completely blind, I have some usable vision (I can read magnified texts and use a computer screen with heavy use of Zoomtext).  My primary issues of concern are my complete blindness in low light, and my absence of peripheral vision.  My central vision is usable as I said, but it is very limited.  I was under the impression that guide dogs were more for people who were totally blind, but that's not the impression I am getting from this particular specialist.  Is there anyone out there who uses a guide dog, or has used a guide dog with some vision?  What was your experience like applying for various schools?  What was your experience at the schools?  For anyone who currently uses one, what is it like day to day?  The advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks! \n",

      "Can I benefit from a cruise to Norway? I‘m considering going on a cruise to Norway. All the stops are small villages, so you can‘t do a lot except for looking at the nature. On the ship there will be a lot of activities. I love looking at landscapes and am fascinated by Arctic ecosystems, but I have a visual acuity of 0.02, so I‘m not sure if seeing it live will really be that great an experience or I‘m better off keeping to look at photos on which I can zoom in and therefore see things better. The cruise is quite expensive, although within my budget. So, I‘m a afraid to spend that much money on something that could turn out really disappointing.The alternative would be to do a cruise to somewhere else where we could do more on shore excursions. I probably should say that I‘m travelling with my partner who has even less vision than me and doesn‘t particularly care where we go.Does anyone have experiences with something like this? \n",

      "Studies into the effects of hearing loss/deafness and MDMA. Hi, I’m a 24 years old man who’s been born with a profound hearing loss.Usually I find social interaction in groups or noisy situations with a lot of background noise really stressful, frustrating and isolating to deal with. Partly because I’m constantly playing catch up with conversations a lot of time, also by the time you’ve asked someone to repeat what they’ve said by the 4th or 5th time they usually have switched off.Communication is a part of daily life, there’s no escaping it.  Furthermore having these additional obstacles and challenges in place with a profound hearing loss, you often have to focus twice as hard just to hear and listen to what others are saying.Last night I went to a music event where I took a small dose of MDMA, its effects didn’t start until around after a hour of taking it. By this time it had gradually become a lot easier and relaxing to connect, interact and communicate with people. This was usually just by asking people I passed if they were having a nice night, if they liked the music that was being played or by dancing and seeing who else was really into the music being played at the time. This often sometimes then led to someone else joining in to dance spreading contagiously across the dance floor. I felt very calm and at ease with myself for most the night, it felt a relieving experience to not feel so stressed or frustrated with myself as I usually do from trying to hear and interact with people.Sometimes people clearly didn’t want to interact too though that was okay as there was always someone else to interact or talk to. Having a hearing loss you sometimes feel so isolated that all you want is for people to validate and acknowledge you. I came across people who weren’t having a good time too such as one guy who was sat in a corner with his hands over his face and his body language all closed off. I asked him if was alright and if the people nearby were his friend. I didn’t know if they were or what he was going through though I gave him a quick hug and pat on the back before carrying on through the night.I know hearing people will  not maybe fully understand the true extent of how hearing loss affects a person, or that sometimes I feel at ends with myself that I’m the only person going through these challenges right now and that my voice isn’t always heard. It hit me that really other people too are also going through just as many of their own hardships, issues and challenges in life too. It doesn’t and shouldn’t make you a weak person or any less of a person or human being just because you have a hearing loss.  Overall it made me think and reflect how I should deal with these situations with a more positive attitude, to be kinder to myself and not become so stressed or upset when I can't hear or grasp whats being said.I’m not saying that a person should have to take ‘x’ to feel better or that you should rely on ‘x’ to help you though has anyone else found taking a substance or drug have positive health benefits for you?Also have any scientific studies or research been done on the possible health effects of hearing loss and MDMA?TL:DR:- Took MDMA at a club, it helped me experience myself differently and reflect on myself in a more positive way. Have anyone experienced something similar under a substance? \n",

      "Completely blind user with many questions about Twitch streaming/streams Hey all, I recently got a Twitch account to listen to some streams and wanted to get more info about how the whole thing works. While I've figured out how to use it on my iPhone, I was hoping some people here could answer some questions about it.First off, I wouldn't mind streaming one day. The idea of interacting with people and possibly having them help me play a game through the chat is really intriguing. My wife is also sighted, so I think it might be fun to play something and have her interacting on the stream itself with me and the chat.Unfortunately, I think I'm at a disadvantage for this. While I know there are streamers who are completely blind like myself, it appears that a lot of them use a PC or console like PS5 or Xbox for their setup. I'm on a Mac mini and iOS so it has me locked into Apple's ecosystem. From what I can gather, this eliminates a lot of accessibility options as most (maybe all) game mods for accessibility and accessible bots for chat work on a PC. Is this indeed the case or are there completely blind users that game and stream on a Mac? What is the variety for accessible games to play on Mac OS? It also feels like most ports of a console game go to PC and not Mac.In addition, I'm curious to know how complicated it is to make streaming accessible on a PC vs. a console. I read an article about it at  but a lot of that was a bit over my head.Finally, does anyone have some streamers they can recommend? I'm always looking for some new ones and would like to follow more gamers who are completely blind. On the flipside, I'm also looking for those who are particularly descriptive while playing so I can follow along. I listen to a video game podcast and would really like to hear some good playthroughs of the titles I've previously heard about.Beyond that, I have some smaller questions about how specific things work and hope some users here might be able to address them via DM. I just don't want to clog things up in the sub with a million minor things as I continue along my journey.Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer! \n",

      "A programmer with some questions Good Afternoon r/blind, first I would like to introduce myself.  I am a programmer who is moving from back end development (the nuts and bolts of programs) to front end development (the stuff the user interacts with).  One of my passions is to always make my front ends as accessible as possible while still maintaining a sophisticated and usable space for those without physical impairments.Can you give me examples of sites that do a really good job of working with screen readers as well as sites that do not?Also, I noticed a lack of really good keyboards for those folks with low vision.  Specifically I was reading about incompatibilities with Windows 10 and was curious what your preferred devices are?Can you give me information on specific software you use to read the web, and also any challenges you encounter?One resource I have been using to read up on accessibility is this: goal is to begin working on the bootstrap accessibility plugin on github in a few weeks.  I also have a keen interest in creating device drivers for nonstandard things like keyboards and mice for those with motor function or visual impairment, especially older models that cost large sums of money that have become outdated due to operating system upgrades. \n",

      "Recommendation , ideally from people with night blindness who understand what helps. for a torch for my partner. Available in the UK and ideally on Amazon or in a common high street shop (need before Christmas) Note: I bought a head torch for him last year, as he kept getting hit by cars, which was very bright but he ended up tripping etc because the battery ran out half way from the train station. I returned it.  It needs at least an hour charge in it at full lumen.He wanted a torch from RNIB but they don't have any on their website or anything that I can find regarding torches for night blindness. I think it would really give him more freedom and make walking at night safer. Please also let me know if I am overestimating how much this could help. Many thanks \n",

      "CODA Question: how to talk to my parents Hi, I am a CODA (29F), both my parents have been deaf their entire lives. Me and my siblings were not brought up using sign language. My grandparents don’t know any sign language and were very pro-oral upbringing.My parents did go to deaf schools and I consider their mother tongue to be sign language (Flemish sign language).Long story short: this was not a good idea, I have some resentment towards how this whole situation came to be. I know hindsight is 20-20 but I believe our childhood and our relationship with our parents would have been far better if we were just raised bi-lingual in both Dutch and FSL. As a result of not being raised in SL, we all struggled to connect and communicate with our parents, but I, as the eldest was heavily parentified because I had to help my parents all the time and had to act as a interpreter without even knowing how to sign. As the only child that was forced to try my best to communicate with them, I am the only one that got kind of interested in the whole culture. I have started studying sign language in evening school, currently in my second year of three. My question is this: how do I incorporate sign while talking to them in family settings. I don’t know if this is the case in other sign languages, but we learnt that the vocabulary in sign is not the same as it is in spoken language. But first of all: when my parents talk, either in sign or in Dutch, they don’t really follow the “correct” grammar? And second: in social gatherings with my family, I want to talk to them so they can follow the conversation (because they often get left out because no one speaks SL or makes the effort to talk slow and annunciate properly), but I want it so everyone is able to participate in the conversation.Is it acceptable to speak Dutch while using the appropriate signs, even when this isn’t the correct order of the words? I hope this question is clear like this! TIA \n",

      "Positive Genetic Diagnosis - Optic Atrophy, UCHL1, Spasticity, Ataxia, Neuropathy #Oxford University Hospital, United Kingdom Blindness can often be associated with other medical conditions, sometimes just one gene mutation can result in number of different conditions.I’ve recently been diagnosed with a genetically inherited condition, there is currently no name for it. The dominant element of it at the moment for me, is Optic Atrophy, but the other conditions that this genetic mutation can result in include the following ***spasticity, ataxia, neuropathy, and optic atrophy***. It’ is called a late onset condition meaning these symptoms may not show till later on in life. But when they do will slowly get worse.I was part of a genetic study that was seeded anonymously from the 100,000 genome project at Oxford University Hospital. Ten families in the UK (of which I’m one) and 6 in Germany have been identified as carry a mutation in their DNA that results in 1, some or all of the medical conditions mentioned about. The gene in responsible is UCHL1.This is the link to the “Abstract” about the trial and conditions identified), if it is of interest I can forward on the full medical paper.[ results in the study have highlighted that a mutation in the UCHL1 gene, can result in the above-mentioned health conditions. Now that the gene has been identified and added to the testing panel, doctors can check a patient’s DNA relatively quickly and give families a genetic answer to their health problems.These are the words of my Genetic Counsellor; I feel they explain things really well:-*For your reference, your genetic change/variant is: UCHL1 c.532C>T; p.Arg178Ter. This means that in your 3.2 billion letters of genetic code, this one single letter “spelling mistake” is causing your condition. There is a letter ‘T’ at a point in the code that should have a ‘C’ and this new combination of letters tells the DNA to ‘STOP’ being read from that point onwards. This means that the resulting gene protein is much shorter than it should be, and this is what causes ataxia and optic neuropathy in your family.*Dr George Tofaris PhD, MBBChir, FRCP is the doctor part credited with the above paper that identified the UCHL1 gene.If you are reading this email, were in the 100,000 genome project i and feel you may be mentioned in this paper I would like to hear from you as it would be good to connect. if you are on this group from other parts of the world and the UCHL1 gene means something to you, please get in touch.I should add I’m not medical, just someone with a genetic mutation! If any of the above is of interest, please let me know and I can provide more information and direction. The more people that get matched correctly with the condition will add weight to the pharmaceutical companies to develop the gene therapy that could one day eradicate this condition or even restore patient’s sight.If you've had genetic condition for your eye condition and its come back negative, get retested if you have any OA and any of the above other conditions![ \n",

      "Hard of hearing/deaf jokes/acts for hearing people? I'm Male, 24, born with a profound hearing loss. Many times I find social situations with hearing people especially groups stressful, anxious, difficult to join in and usually frustrating to the point I reflect very negatively or consciously upon myself. Whenever that could be being very aware of the way my voice sounds 'different' and somewhat more monotonus to a hearing person or generally feeling that I miss out on being able to emotionally express myself or connect with people in general among other reasons.Instead of getting in a state about it, which realistically there's not very much I can do about improving my hearing further. I've been thinking about ways and coping mechanisms to effectively interact with hearing people to an advantage whilst having this hearing-loss without feeling either rejected or like you're the 'better part of a bargain'.So far humour I found has been the most effective (I.e -actual event from joke. \"I thought a friend asked me if I wanted a cheese-scone, when really he asked me if I wanted to choose a song\" I just saw this comedy video of a Swedish comedian: -  this video he follows an audio tape about magic, though notice he has a banana instead of a 'bandana' which the audio tape instructs by. It suddenly struck me that perhaps say for example the next time you mishear or misinterpret some speech in a conversation. You think a person has said 'X' but really he said 'S' you starting doing what this comedian was doing as if you heard 'X'. If anyone asks what you were doing you'd say ' Oh, I thought you meant 'X' not 'S'. And as you can see in the video, the audience's loves it. Could this be a possible way changing what usually can be a tiring, frustrating ordeal of a situation into something positive, funny and shows you're not too serious to talk/ bring up your hearing-loss?Or maybe people know their own/other ways of using their hearlng-loss to their advantage? \n",

      "Useful Video descriptions on Social media Hello! I work in social media and am not deaf or HOH. Our team is always looking for ways to improve the accessibility of our content and I had a question regarding videos/reels/Tiktoks. I am wondering, in the opinion of someone who is deaf or HOH,  if it is helpful to include on screen descriptions such as, \"Background music plays throughout the video,\" on something like a reel? Is it obvious and distracting from the video, or is it appreciated? Would it be best added to a caption rather than on screen, (if there is space)?   We do not currently use videos with speaking or lyrics because of bilingual rules in our organization so we do not add CC besides mentioning music. I ask because we are playing around with adding more onscreen text and it often looks very busy to have both in such a small space. I appreciate your thoughts. TIA! \n",

Anyway, here's what she said:>  I have an urgent question regarding alternative communication:> Is there a telephone, suitable for the speech impaired, yet hearing? And if so, is it possible to put it on speakerphone, walk away while you are on hold (especially when trying to accomplish phone business, as so often- one is put on hold). Then, type your responses in a way that they will be translated to the individual on the other end of the phone line (without the other party needing any special equipment)? If so, where can the assistive device be purchased, located, and which phone company can provide such services? And, will incoming phone calls be automatically translated? \n",

It was hard to participate because of how much I typed.” He said this to me after todays meeting. At todays meeting I was so focused on trying to understand what everyone was saying that I couldn’t imagine what to type up for the minutes!Does anyone have any tips for taking meeting minutes?

Are there standup shows for deaf people by deaf people, performed in sign language? If not, why not?

      "Interesting story. About two years ago, I met someone who lives in the Philippines. We talked online for the longest time. I started to fall for her, someone that I didn't know what she looked like. About 6 months. Every day, I would get home so I can chat with her. Then, we started sending snapchats, and we would chat more and more. We never called, she never answered. When we skyped, it was typing while videoing. We started becoming really really close. One time, she mentioned something about her not being able to hear her mom calling people in the house. I didn't think much of it. I thought she meant she is part deaf or doesn't pay attention. So fast forward to last month. She moved to the USA, and stayed in San Fran. Then yesterday, she moved to San Diego. Words can't express how exited and happy this made me. So today, I got to meet her. This wonderful person who is about my age, and the kindest, sweetest person I have ever met. She walks up to my car, and she is literally the most beautiful person I have ever met. She gets in my car, and I ask her how her day is so far, and how the travel was. She said it was really tiring. I noticed her accent was unlike any I have ever heard. She is also really quiet. That's okay, I don't mind. It's just a little hard to hear her. Whenever I said something without looking at her, she wouldn't know. I, being the dumbass that I am, didn't really realize. We talked for a good few hours at the beach, and watched the sunset. Somehow in the conversation, I asked her what her favorite song is. She asked me to repeat it. I asked her for her favorite kind of music. \"I'm deaf, I can't hear.\"This was the most awkward situation I have ever been in. I was talking to her for many hours, and I didn't know that she was deaf. It turns out, she just laughed and said that she was a reeeeally good lip reader. Which she certainly is. It was really interesting, I thought someone might have found this interesting at the least. TL;DR I fell in love with a girl who was deaf, but I didn't know she was deaf until 6 hours into our conversation. I still love her, and now it's time for me to learn ASL. \n",

      "Nontypical Name Sign Question I have a question about name signs that I'm not really able to get guidance on from my Deaf friends (none of them are sure). I though I might put the question to a wider group and see.My wife and I are both hearing. I'm an interpreter, but more importantly to this situation, we are also very involved in our local Deaf community and many of our friends are Deaf. About a year ago, when our son was born, our Deaf friends started asking us what sign name we were giving him. For obvious reasons, we were surprised. However, I couldn't get any real guidance about this even from our friends. They would say we could so that but struggled to explain the cultural nuance.Now for my question. Can hearing parents (with a hearing child), who are involved in the Deaf community, give their child a sign name or should the Deaf give the child a sign name? Is it acceptable for hearing parents to do so?For the record, we haven't given him one and decided to wait for a Deaf person to do it. I'm just not sure, culturally what's going on here. For a child, growing up in the Deaf community, are the Deaf or the parents responsible to give him a sign name?Thanks, r/deaf !!!EDIT: I'm in America. \n",

      "Gallaudet ASL Summer Programs I've been a HoH individual since birth (a hereditary condition from my Father's side of the family), having received my first pair of hearing aids when I was younger (6 - 9). I've always been able to cope with them for a good majority of my life, but as I've gotten older (35 now), my hearing has worsened to the point that I'm already on the strongest power aids and still have trouble with conversations. To that end, I figured now was a good a time as any to begin looking into learning ASL now. Even when in my BS and MS programs in College, I was never good at keeping up with online and self-paced learning - I prefer a classroom type environment, which helps to keep me focused. Since I live within the Baltimore-DC metro region, I figured that Gallaudet was the perfect place to do so.

      "Confused girlfriend needs advice :/ Hi everyone,My boyfriend has a hearing loss. I don't. We are in our late 20s-early 30s. He has hearing aids and can hear almost normally with them in. We have a great relationship and his hearing loss doesn't really affect our relationship all that much.However, my boyfriend was not as able to hear as clearly when he was a child because he did not have digital hearing aids back then. To this day he still has a speech impediment that is noticeable as a result. Another thing is, to someone who doesn't know him well, it may appear that he is lip reading intently in conversation. (He can lip read but he doesn't need to rely on it, since he can hear well enough.) He says he does this out of habit. Either way, it is something that often surprises people when they first meet him. I have discovered that this can lead to awkward situations. My friend confessed to me that her friend wanted to start signing to him because she felt that he may have been more comfortable (which is not true, and he doesn't use sign language.) Today one of my friends told me I need to be honest with people before they meet him so they know what to expect. I'm not sure how to handle this situation, I really don't want anyone to look at my boyfriend differently or treat him differently (and he wouldn't want that either.) Is there a good way to tell people beforehand that my boyfriend is hard of hearing, but that he doesn't need to read your lips and you don't need to sign or use gestures to converse with him?Thanks for reading :) \n",

I wanted to share a game I created for a girl at my summer camp that maybe someone would want to create for a child’s birthday party or game night.I few years ago I worked at a summer camp and there was a carnival day planned. All camp groups were invited to create their own games for their peers to play. As I observed the games that were being made, I realized that none of them were accessible to a camper who was visually impaired. I wanted to be able to make sure that she was able to participate, so I came up with a game that didn’t rely on seeing to play.I called my game Penny Pong and this was the set up:I got one of those 18 gallon storage bins and filled it up 75% with ping pong balls.Afterwards I took out maybe 10-20 ping pong balls and using a box cutter, cut a slit into it and put a penny inside. When you shook those ping pong balls you would hear a nice jingle! And it also felt heavier than the empty ones.Afterwards I put the ping pong balls back into the bin with the hundred other look alikes.The goal of the game was to rely on your touch and hearing to grab as many “penny pong” balls as you could within the 30-60 second time limit and put them in another bin set aside the main one.When you put your hands in the big bin you grab as many ping pong balls as possible and shake them to hear if there is a penny inside. It’s a race against the clock!It was a hit and my game had the longest line in the carnival! All the campers loved it and they had to rely on only their hearing and feeling the weight of the ball to win!If anyone ever ends up setting this up I would love to hear about it! Also if something like this already exists please let me know! \n",

      "I need the bass! I've been HoH my entire life. I was told by my doctors as a child to expect full deafness and that I should take great care of my ears to ensure I get the most mileage out of them as humanly possible. I didn't follow that advice and my hearing has plummeted in the past few years. I'm unable to hear much if anything out of my left ear and my right ear (which has never been good) seems to be going quickly. All that said, I love music with all my heart. I grew up listening to everything from Fleetwood Mac, Tupac, Notorious, tech noir, country, jazz, and even classical. If I am totally honest, I'm afraid of losing the music.I am looking for home stereo system recommendations with deep and loud bass (for that thumping feeling) so I can memorize my favorite tunes and the thumping they give off. That way when my hearing does finally go, I can turn it up and hopefully feel the memorized beats and hear the songs in my head and memories. I've started learning ASL, and even use hearing aids which help a little, but am hoping you good people will have some ideas to help in this particular area. Thanks in advance! \n",

      "What things are loud when you didn't expect them to be? I'm hearing, and this is my first question to the Deaf community. I've read all the rules and watched a lot of videos about Deaf culture, and I haven't seen anyone discuss this...so hopefully it's an original question.My question is...what things surprised you when you found out they were loud to hearing people? And also, the opposite question...what things did you think were loud to hearing people, but you were surprised were actually quiet?And the deaf people I've met have all been really pretty aware of sounds. I'm fully aware that living in a mostly hearing world forces deaf people to think about sounds all the time. So, I'm NOT asking if deaf people are aware of sounds...I know you are. I'm just wondering, which specific things that make sounds, or which specific sounds, didn't you realize were as loud or quiet as they were...for a long time?As I've been thinking about this question myself the last few weeks, I've noticed that water is always pretty loud. And I never noticed that before I came up with this question a few weeks ago. Like, there's nothing that water does that's not loud. And I'm not sure if it's just because my ears are tuned to listen for water, and so it seems loud to me, or if it is actually loud. So, I was thinking that if I couldn't ever hear, that I would probably be surprised that people thought that me shaking a water bottle was about as loud as me dropping some books.Hopefully my question makes sense, and hopefully it's a respectful question. \n",

      "audio players that are compelling for deaf communities? I'm helping a friend with some research on music and audio devices that could influence the collection at a major cultural institution. Please excuse my naiveté about deaf issues!We have been looking at some devices, possibly gimmicky, that are marketed as potentially useful / interesting / compelling for deaf individuals but wanted to get a sense of which devices, if any, have had real utility or impact.Things we're looking at:• Bone conducting headphones-- these are only useful for certain types of hearing loss, of course. Are they popular among deaf / hearing impaired individuals for whom they can work?• Vibration / haptic vests -- in addition to gamers, these are sometimes marketed as providing a type of music experience for the deaf. Are these used widely for this purpose?• Other visual music players / vibration devices of various kinds. Same question as above.There's a broader implicit question here as well-- are many deaf individuals interested in having experiences with music in various forms or is this type of marketing and approach considered gimmicky and pointless in deaf communities?I would really appreciate and thoughts, personal experiences positive or negative or indifferent, etc! It could have a real impact on insitutional knowledge in this area.p.s. i encourage everyone to google the 'Bone Fone' if you want to see some hilarious 70's marketing materials for a very crappy music device (great packaging though). \n",

      "Need advice on developing a special game Hi all! I'm an independent game developer, a few months ago I began working on an idea for an innovative game that uses no visuals at all, but the whole experience is entirely based on sound. Mind you, this is not just a simple sound game, it actually create an immersible experience that takes the player on a sound journey over his/her hearing senses, triggering new brain patterns and raising awareness of the world of sounds around us. I know that there are already a couple of 3d sound navigation games, but I want to go much further from that, using sound puzzles.I released a first early prototype to explore and test the idea and many testers told me to get in touch with blind people, as this would be a great game.While the focus of the game is not to be a blind-people's game, the fact that it totally relies on sound and doesn't depend on anything visual to be played, makes it a great game for the blind too.Thus, it is now my intention, that I continue to make the game taking blind people in consideration, so that they also have access to a this very restrict form of entertainment (where practically every game requires visual feedback).I thought about writing to a few blind associations and groups to seek some support and informal \"partnerships\" with no luck. Then I thought to ping reddit and ask here.I'm looking for blind-people (or people with experience), to test and advice during the making of this game. I'd also like to have the chance to interview and perhaps discuss about the ways blind people use sound in their daily lives to get awareness of what is around them, etc.Basically, I'm looking for a chance to establish a simple dialogue with a few people who might be interested in this topic.If you are curious enough to give a try to this prototype, you can read about it and download here:  that the prototype is probably not easy to set up and start without visual cues... when I did it I did not have that in consideration :(Hope to hear back from you,all the best \n",

      "Relationships Hi everyone. I'm 25 years old & have SSD (single sided deafness). It used to bother me a lot mentally but more the most part I've developed the internal strength to deal with the problems it poses in everyday life & I'm proud to admit that I'm independant, active in the martial arts for about 2 1/2 years, play a few musical instruments competently, & am employed with a company that I like. The mental fortitude is mostly down to being engaged with stoic philosophy, the works of Aurelius, Epictetus & Seneca.I don't often talk with other people about my disability because I don't want anyone to treat me any different than they would a normal person. In this respect, I've actually ended up forming a lot of friendships/acquaintances who aren't aware that I'm deaf in one ear. However, I also haven't been in a relationship for a few years now & am hesitant to date someone who doesn't share my disability. I am also reluctant to burden (this may be entirely mental) another person in a full bill of health with the trappings of my disability. I feel like the odds of meeting someone with the characteristics I desire are slimmer than if I was in regular fitness & thus have difficulty. I wish I could meet someone who understands the difficulties I face AND is compatible in ways apart from this. I was wondering what this community thought, as it's the only real place from which I feel I can get feedback from understanding people. \n",

Also, maybe someone who uses JAWs or Voiceover can help me test. I’m starting to lose my vision. I have increased the font and screen resolution on my Mac and am using VoiceOver to help. I was applying for a government job that uses the NeoGov platform and I’ve heard it isn’t very accessible. I had everything ready to apply for the job but ran into issues actually applying. I couldn’t access the “Proceed to Review” button once everything was filled out. I struggled and found a way past it with some help and when everything was ready to submit, I got an error that my Login session had expired. I didn’t hear anything from VoiceOver and nothing notified me on the screen visually that it was about to expire or that would even happen. I scrambled to get back in and apply but since it took so long the first time and then I ended up getting booted off, the system would no longer let me apply as it was now midnight and the job disappeared. I sent an email to someone at the agency I applied to a week ago and haven’t heard back. At first I figured it was all my fault and started to get depressed. Then I got mad because I realized how inaccessible this system was and it doesn’t seem fair to have these barriers.  What do I do now? It was the perfect job for me and I feel like I had a really good chance. Would anyone be willing to review the site and apply for a job and see if they experience the same issues I did?  I’m just so sad and still getting used to JAWs and VoiceOver. Thank you for any help! \n",

      "Here's a site that lets you feel what Apple's activity/fitness achievements look like Hey all,  is a website that sells pins. Specifically, the pins contain Apple's fitness/activity awards. If you're not an Apple Watch user, and don't know anyone who is, you can stop reading now. This will be of no interest to you. Every time you earn an award, like Longest Move Streak or Perfect Stand Week, the watch alerts you. It also shows an image. Each achievement has its own image. If you're curious what they look like, have some extra money, and like pins, this website is perfect. Each pin is between $9 and $12, not including shipping. I just got two of these pins today. They have very, very strong magnets on the back to hold them in place--they are not the usual pin design with a pointy end. More importantly, the design is raised, letting you feel it. For instance, I now know that the Longest Move Streak is a somewhat stylized infinity symbol, and exactly how each half is curved. Are these important? No. Will most people see them as a waste of money? Of course. I'm not disputing that. But if you want to actually know what the achievements feel like, these are a reasonably-priced way to do that. I realize I'm talking to a niche audience here, but for the very few of you who may find this to be of interest, well, now you know. \n",

      "\"Oh, I'm sorry, we can't hire you. I didn't realize you were deaf.\" I wanted to share this story.  It's not mine, but it frustrated me, and I wanted to share it anyway.I was talking to a HoH friend last night.  She was born hearing, became an interpreter for English and her native language, and worked as a 'terp for many years before her hearing started to decline.  Once it did, she started learning ASL, and now uses both signing and hearing aides to compensate.  She stopped being an active 'terp, and instead switching to teaching interpreting at schools and colleges.  There, background done.She's been applying to jobs in the area, and got a response from a local company interested in having her come in and teach a group of people about interpreting or something...  details not important.  They arranged a phone interview (she's able, with HAs, to handle calls still) and the interview went great.  At the end, after the interviewer had pretty much offered her the position, he asked \"Are you comfortable teaching large groups of people?\"  She replied, paraphrasing, \"I prefer small groups.  I'm hard of hearing, and if students are too far away, I can't hear them very well.\"His reply was flooring.  He stammered and replied, \"Oh, well, um, I'm sorry, but our organization can't afford to hire an ASL interpreter for you.  We simply don't have the funds for both you and your interpreter.  I'm sorry, we can't hire you,\" and hung up.. . . . . . .Yeah.  That.  ...  Thanks for reading. \n",

One button has the cane emit a red, pulsing light, one button emits a sold white light, and the third button emits a loud alarm sound. It's not perfect but it might be helpful if you're feeling threatened. There were also many different magnifiers, cctv, and canes. Revolution now makes a cane adapter tip so that ambitech tips can be used on revolution canes. There were various glasses in development also. One pair that I particularly liked somehow projected the image onto my retina. It was amazing. Another pair takes a photo of what it is pointed at and reads the text to you via earbud. And finally, there is a music program that works with Braille displays! It also the user to scan or download a music score, play along, play alone, or edit. To scroll they have developed special foot pedals so that your hands can stay on the keyboard. I'll sort through all my fliers later and post names if anyone is interested! \n",

      "Requirements for digital braille readers Hi everyone, I have recently stumbled across a few articles which describe the challenges faced by programmers without the ability to see. I was curious to discover alternate means by which information can be accessed by the blind, especially in the context of programming. One of the important semantic differences between literature and a computer program is that the details matter, equally as much as the general trend of the document. For this reason, audio readers, which may work well for digital print media, would seem to struggle in the field of program development.There are digital braille readers, yet the majority of these devices cost in excess of two thousand pounds, with some exceeding over twice that. It seems to me that the reasons for such costs are a result of a lack of competition, development stagnation and a relatively niche market. This is not to say that there are few willing to use such a device, but rather such devices have a specific relevance to the visually impaired.I am curious to determine what the requirements of a digital braille reader might be, and also to sample people's own experiences, to determine if it would be beneficial outside of the software development context.For those with experience of reading Braille:-  When you read a document, how many fingers do you use at once? I've seen mention of using the two index fingers. Is it feasible to use a single finger?-  Does the process of moving one's finger along a sentence provide quicker or easier understanding of its meaning than a character wise substitution would?-  If you have used a digital Braille reader, what were your experiences? What were the benefits and disadvantages?-  What would you consider a comfortable rate of characters / words per minute when reading Braille?About me:My name is Angus Hollands,I'm a nineteen year old student currently reading Nuclear Science at university. I have experience in a number of programming languages and electronics.Thank you for your time! \n",

      "Cute Deaf Love Story So my first college roommate was raised by a Deaf guy and a Hearing gal. The Hearing mother happens to work as an interpreter and ASL instructor for the nearby New England interpreter course. The Deaf dad works in theater, largely as a tech director. Dad is born Deaf from a Deaf family, but he went to mainstream schools so he knows how to speak but rarely wants to. Their kids are both fluent in ASL.They met on one of the shows he was in. Now, both of them were just starting their careers. Him as a stagehand, her with her first interpreting gig. Now, when you’re starting out in a theater career, you never exactly have the luxury of picking the jobs you want, so he was working backstage at a Hearing play. She really didn’t need to be at any rehearsals but the dress rehearsal and the performances, so he didn’t see her until then. He was instantly attracted to her, so he started asking her a whole bunch of yes/no questions about herself. He did that the entire dress rehearsal. He also didn’t know she was the interpreter, since nobody bothered to tell him directly.At the end of the first dress rehearsal, he comes up to her and says, “It was nice to meet you.” She responds by signing, “Nice to meet you too! See you tomorrow.” He immediately signs back, “YOU CAN SIGN? WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME?” All she signed back was, “You didn’t ask,” with a smirk, then left. 25 years later, they’re happily married with two kids, and great careers.  \n",

      "[Question] Browsing reddit/the internet? Hey, I'm not blind but I'm very interested in learning how people with disabilities are able to cope with everyday activities that most folks take for granted. This felt like the best place to ask, so here goes! How do you browse reddit, and the internet in general? Is there a kind of braille reader that allows you to read the text? How do braille keyboards work? And finally, what is it like browsing while on the move (e.g. on laptops, tablets and mobile phones)?P.S. Who would win in a fight between a giant, 1-tonne duck and 1 tonne of normal-sized ducks? \n",

      "Establishing a University Student Society I currently attend an university and am near the end of the first year of my studies and I've been thinking about setting up a student society for fellow likeminded students which would help me find students who enjoy the same thing as I do and it'll look great on my resume when I complete my studies.I'm working out the details of the group and will eventually try and gauge interest before going ahead with contacting the university for permission to establish it. It probably won't be implemented until my second or third year so I don't have to worry whether I'm rushing into something I can't do as effectively as I'd like.I'm fully aware that my hearing impairment would make founding such a group taking a leadership position a bit difficult and was wondering if there were any deaf or HoH individuals on this subreddit who had prior experience and had some helpful advice.Advice from hearing individuals are welcome too.**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the encouragement and advice. I'll be going ahead with preparations to establish the group. Hopefully all goes well. \n",

      "Question about interpreters Hi all. I have been HOH for several years. I'm also highly educated (doctorate) and have always said I wanted to use my degree to help other people. I've been thinking for a while now that maybe I should become an interpreter, especially since my field (medical) requires knowing a lot of specialized language that the average ASL interpreter wouldn't be familiar with. I'm not currently fluent in ASL. I can sign, but not that well. I mostly read lips and write things down, but since I became HOH in my 20s (in early 30s now) I've been used to living in the hearing world and it's been more of a gradual adjustment.I'm wondering what people who have been deaf most or all of their lives think about all of this? I am well aware of deaf culture and how I'm an outsider coming in later. I also have ASD so I've felt like an outsider and the more exaggerated expressiveness of signing (using your whole body and face to communicate, not subtle) has always felt like home and comforting to me, even before my hearing ability changed. I'm sincere in my desire to learn and hope to be well-received.If anyone has specific advice related to this, I'm in the greater Phoenix, Arizona area in the US. \n",

      "Hearing Student afraid to sign with Deaf People Hello! I have a question for y'all. (I tried searching it in the sub, but I couldn't find anything, sorry if this is a bit abundant).I'm an ASL 1 student that was accepted into the ASL Honor Society this year. With all honor societies, you have to gain and maintain a GPA and service/participation hours. To gain participation hours, a lot of it is stuff like Deaf Expos, Deaf coffee, etc. And this scares me.My absolute worst fear is offending culture, and especially one I heavily appreciate. I don't know if the d/D/HoH people near me are  fine with hearing students, or if we bother them. I have Deaf internet friends, which I'm perfectly fine with; however, in person may be a different story. I'd imagine signing and saying something incorrectly (like wrong tense), and having them respond with something like \"typical hearing minded person\" or something similar.So the question I bring here is this: Do you dislike hearing students? What can I do to maybe get over this? Am I over reacting?I truly hope this isn't an offensive post - I didn't intend for it to be one. I'm not afraid of Deaf people, but talking in any language that's not my native one to a native speaker/signer IS my fear.  \n",

      "I need help in regards to my brother, and figured this might be the best place to ask This is going to be a bit long probably, so bear with me, please. My brother is deaf, and is in his 40's. That's not a problem. The problem is he is still a child mentally, in relation to how the world works, and isn't able to live on his own. He's lived with our mom his whole life(our father is deceased) but now she isn't able to do as she's done before, and it's seriously affecting his health. I live across the country, and can't even afford to visit, let alone get him to come live with me. My sister lives relatively close to them, but isn't able to do much either, she has five children, has no room to get him to live with her, works, and even though she is all the time offering help to our mother, mom refuses it. Just today, my brother was scheduled for an echo cardiogram and stress tests. However, mom can no longer drive, so for medical appointments they've been relying on medical bus services. Today, the driver called out sick, and he missed his appointment. Mom didn't even let my sister know about it until 2 hours later. The reason my brother was scheduled for these tests? Well, back at Christmas, he was coughing a lot and complaining of pain in his torso. Whether it was chest or stomach is unclear, but sister says he said it hurt too bad for him to even lay down, so off to the hospital they went. Come to find out he hasn't been taking his medication for blood pressure, or his diabetes. Apparently mom says he \"ran out.\" Sister asks how come mom has her own meds refilled but not brother's. Mom says \"Oh well he has to take care of it and do what he needs to.\" Trouble is she should know after 40 years that he just isn't. But then she's also let him be more of a child who can eat and do whatever he wants once he was out of school so not too sure if she even realizes how much he's not going to be responsible enough to say he needs his medication refilled, let alone take it when he should. He went to the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind, graduated from there in the 80's. They live in WV now, near Romney, so that school is closer to them than Staunton. I only say that because I don't know where to start to go about getting him help, and I just sent an email off to the VA school inquiring if they have any resources for former students or if they can point me in the right direction. Then I remembered I can ask a whole community of folks who might be willing to help, or know what I can do or where to turn to for help. My sister has been trying to find a group home for him, but every place she talks to when she finally gets to talk to someone, they all tell her to go to place C or right back the place A that suggested place B to begin with. Mom isn't being much of a help, she thinks it's a damn joke when sister tells her she's trying to find a better place for brother to go. She won't even help herself, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms though for a completely different sub. Even before the most recent of events we've been fighting with her about a lot of things. This latest is probably going to be that final straw to break the camel's back. And by that I mean my sister is close to going completely nuts herself and I know with half her kids in high school and the other half barely in elementary and out of diapers is just icing on her cake. God, I wish so much I could get back home to do *something,* I love them all, and don't want to see this played out like my pessimistic and cynical butt is thinking it will if something isn't done. So here I am, hopefully asking folks who can help. I'm sorry this was long, and I do apologize if at any time I ranted more than explained anything, and if there are any issues that need clarification, please ask, I will answer to the best of my ability. Thanks in advance for any help anyone has to offer. TL;DR: My brother's living situation may be putting his health at risk, mom won't do anything to help fix it, sister and I don't know what to do or where to turn.  \n",

They are of retirement age and they live alone as well.I would like to get them things that would be of help to them in the home, but I'm not even sure where to start.

      "Hearing aid question Hello there!So I’m brand new to the d/Deaf/hoh community/life - I just got my first pair of HAs about a week ago now (ReSound Linx2) and holy crap I love them! Fab, right? Yeah… Except I keep having to push the part that’s in my ear down farther bc it comes almost fully out sometimes when I talk or eat or even just smile. It’s really annoying and it makes having a hearing aid kind of silly if half the time I can’t hear bc I’m constantly realizing I can’t hear and have to push them deeper into my ear. I posted about my HAs before about how itchy they were and someone suggested getting ear molds made. I really want to try those out but I have some questions -1. Is my hearing aid/are all BTE hearing aids with in ear receiver compatible with ear molds? 2. Does a certain degree of deafness use ear molds? (Like.. Profoundly or more so than me - mild/moderate) 3. One ear is using the HA completely but the other ear only a little- it has an open receiver so that I can also hear “normal” sounds along with the HA sounds… Will this work with ear molds? I heard skeletal ear molds (?) are very uncomfortable…?4. ARE THEY COMFORTABLE??? Is my big need-to-know.. As well as, do they keep the receiver/speaker part deep in your ear?Thank you so much for any advice/knowledge you can provide me with! \n",

      "Specialized vs Public School My little sister is seven. She's doing fine in regular public school for now, but she has hearing aids and will be deaf at some point in young adulthood. The public school system is supposed to be teacher hermy parents, and the youngest siblings plus myself sign language. So far, they aren't even teaching her. I know they have a sign instructor but she isn't teaching my little sister. My sister is only seven and I don't want her to be held back or unable to communicate later, so I've recently taken it upon myself to try and teach myself sign language and then in turn teach her, especially as her hearing is getting noticeably worse (where last year she could marginally hear the K in words like joke, she no longer can). Her teachers work with her as best they can, making sure she can see their mouths, acknowledging her issues and finding work around, but I don't feel like she's getting the support she needs.My parents have the opportunity to send her to a boarding school specifically for deaf and hard of hearing kids. It's two hours away from where we live but I keep pressing them to send her.They don't want to send her away though, for five days or more at a time, and she doesn't want to go either. I don't want to be without her around as well but I feel like it's her best chance to actually learn what she needs though maybe I'm wrong. Is there a way to convince my parents that she needs this school or am I in the wrong and she should just stay in public school? \n",

I'm lost in group conversations.I completed my degree requirements back in Dec 2011.  My degree was in Computer Science.I've been struggling to find work since.  I've had several leads that went deep in the interview process.  For example, for one job, I passed the \"phone\" interview (done online via IM system), passed an online code test (got told I did great on one question, and so-so on the second question), had two technical interviews (one with a senior manager, and the other with a lead developer), and was told that I'd be invited back for an onsite interview.  I was told I had given one of the best answers to a question during one of the technical interviews.They said getting an interpreter would not be a problem.  I referred them to a local agency.  Got back to me and said they requested an interpreter for a given date/time.I got a follow up email saying \"We are exploring all options, stay tuned.\"  Odd.Nothing from them until the day before the planned onsite interview.  Pinged them to see what was going on.  They admitted that nothing was set up and put me on hold.  Stayed on hold until they closed for the day.Next day, an hour before the interview was to take place, they told me that they were going to proceed with other candidates.The general process has been: People seem to like me, like the skills I have, but tend to have concerns about communication.  Then they ultimately pass over me for \"other candidates\".Just how am I supposed to get a job with this sort of attitude?  I feel like I have to run hard, and jump as high as I can while a hearing applicant can just walk up to the plate.It gets harder and harder to get back up to the plate every time this happens.Thanks for reading all this. :) \n",

As I mentioned in the post title, i'd like to get speech to text on a handheld device. I figured if anybody knew of a solution that works it would be the deaf community of Reddit.  I've had a few ideas as to how this might work. I started with Google Glass as a possible interface, but, it looks to me like GG is a sinking ship. So, an Android or IOS device would work, though isn't ideal. I imagine a highly directional microphone coupled with speech recognition software as the basic platform. I know that most mobile speech to text apps rely on a WAN connection in order to shuttle inputs to more powerful machines which return the processed text (a'la Siri.) I'd like for this to *not* rely on an internet connection as most of the time he lives in a very remote area of the country. A server on a LAN could be doable, but then again maybe i'm getting ahead of myself. No need to reinvent the wheel, and I can't be the first person to have thought of this idea.

      "Screen Reader that works well with mouse control? Hello, my uncle has low vision and I'm looking for a screen reader for him that will intelligently read web pages and digital documents out loud. What we've discovered is that most screen readers will either read the text out of order, run them together, or quit after reading only a paragraph or two. For documents, some readers require him to upload the document to their site for it to work properly. This is not ideal because some of the documents are contracts and may contain sensitive information.He's comfortable using a mouse with the pointer being greatly enlarged, but some of the \"buttons\" on the web pages are too small for him to see where they are. Is there a screen reader that will read whatever text is clicked on with a mouse?For physical documents that are text only, he uses a scanner to scan them into a program called Kurzweil 1000. ([  This program is fantastic for text only documents that are scanned directly into the software, but it sometimes has problems with things like a PDF that was captured from an image. If the document he try's to scan is text mixed with images (like a magazine or newspaper) it often fails because it doesn't process images very well. It is not designed to be used for web pages at all. It seems that a screen reader called NVDA is recommended fairly often in this sub-reddit but when I tested it, it was pretty confusing to me while using a mouse. Perhaps it just requires that I get used to how it works?My uncle is fairly picky, to put it mildly. LOL But he want's something that is easy to operate and will just work when he tells it to.

The main concept behind it is that hearing aids are expensive, often as a cheaper alternative people use something like [this]( idea is that, for many people, there is a certain range of frequencies they cannot hear, so the idea is to, in real time, process audio received by the mic to shift or stretch the frequencies to fit within that audible range. Also there will be other signal processing that eliminated background noise. The user will be able to wear headphones, turn on the app, and go.We were also considering adding other features like making use of speech-to-text API to have a kind of \"subtitles\" on life sort of thing. Depending on the limitations like time delays, that might not be real time. Probably also make use of user to user possibilities, such as getting a speaker (say in a lecture or something) to \"broadcast\" through a web app or something, so that users, or \"receivers\" can get better audio.I understand that there is at least [one app]( that does similar things, so we are interested in learning what other features might be desired/useful that these apps may lack.Will will also need user testers at a later date, so any expressions of interest in testing would be greatly appreciated.So if you have any thoughts, criticisms, features you'd like, etc, that maybe we haven't thought of I'd love to know. \n",

So far I haven't found many businesses that offer this; I did find [Fable]( which is great, but only offers full-year, enterprise-level pricing (low end $30K); as we already have a company accessability audit partner, I'm looking at paying for this myself, or probably at most leveraging a team education budget, so that doesn't fit well.

And maybe this is quite ignorant which is why I would like to ask everyone how you achieve awe whether intentional or unintentionally.From what I understand, Experiencing a sense of awe once in a while can be quite important to one’s psychological health. Right now I am reading a book by Sam Harris called waking up. I know lots of people who are not atheists have problems with his writing, but I would like to ask everyone regardless of religion what you think on this topic.    Hoping to get a few good answers, let me know as well if you have read waking up and what you thought about it \n",

      "Reading and Writing in the Deaf community Hi folks, I hope this is an okay place to post this, if it isn't I am sorry!I ran into something today that struck my curiosity, and I am eager to learn more. I was at Vancouver International Airport earlier today going through customs. They have a large board with \"Welcome to Canada\" written on it, and a few simple instructions. The message is written in about 12 different languages. In addition to the written languages, there is also a video on the corner of a man signing the message in ASL. It just got me wondering as to what the purpose of this is. I fully understand that ASL is a language all on its own just like any other, but I also thought that the vast majority of those fluent in ASL would also read and write in another language more suitable for written communication. I understand that for many, ASL is their primary language, so my initial thought was that they included ASL on the sign not so much as a matter of practicality, but, rightfully, as sign of inclusivity and welcomeness. I'm sorry if this question comes off as ignorant, I just was very curious and want to understand more. Regardless, it was great to see so many languages welcoming everyone to Canada!  \n",

We’re not sure how much longer he’ll have his remaining sight as his medication isn’t doing much anymore and he does not want surgery (for multiple reasons). His birthday is in a few month and I really want to do something special for him that is accessible and enjoyable and doesn’t rely on visual gags, decorations, or props. He loves SpongeBob and I had originally planned a SpongeBob theme for him as he’ll be turning 25 (a bit of a cliche but I know he’d love it). But I’m worried about how to properly adjust to account for what he may or may not be able to see.I’m not a big fan myself but it’s important to me to go all out. He’s in for a rough year according to his doctors so I want him to remember that he is loved and appreciated. I could really use some help if there are any other fans out there. \n",

      "F123 Access: An Addon that makes several large improvements to Reddit Accessibility for Firefox Users I'm glad to announce that, thanks to the fast work of the developers of F123 Access, Firefox users can now take advantage of several improvements to Reddit's accessibility.  I emailed them yesterday, and the new features went public today.  The enhancements the extension makes are:1.  The vote button is relabelled after you vote on a submission or comment.  No more forgetting if you upvoted something already or not!  Users of a screen-reader can now tell if one of the vote buttons was pressed, the same way sighted users can.  2.  Comments are placed into nested lists.  This way, screen-readers can now finally tell if a comment is a reply to the previous comment or not!  This is a huge help when navigating through long comment threads, making it both easier to skip uninteresting replies, and much easier to follow the conversation.  You can get more information, and download the addon, at:  well as making accessibility improvements to Reddit, F123 Access can also make improvements to Facebook, Youtube, WhatsApp, and many other websites.  Just choose the enhancements you'd like to enable in the F123 Access preferences once it's installed.   \n",

About a year ago he had a stroke and lost the ability to communicate.

      "My mom is actually ableist but there’s no way I’d ever be able to convince her. I lost my hearing at 2-4 and now have a CI and HA. My parents were always really supportive and helpful, getting the best care and support I needed. I always had the appointments for speech therapy, I had my IEP, my 504, my FM system, and I was fully mainstreamed. I flourished well, besides the obvious shortcomings that are bound to happen. Welp, that was the shiny image of my childhood. But now as I am older, I’ve found out significantly more about the behind the scenes. One notable mention is that I have an SO who has amazing hearing. She can hear across the room in a loud environment perfectly. I have never let anyone in my family know about the extent of it because there’s a strong benefit in getting the gossip and eavesdropping that is going on behind your back. Imagine my surprise when I find out that my mother has been the massive reason for my social life struggle, the reason I wasn’t allowed to do what I wished for as a kid, and the reason for so much ridiculous drama in the family. She always has to make it a point that I am deaf. She’s actively sabotaged potential relationships and friendships behind my back because “I don’t want anyone to judge him or hurt him because he’s deaf”. She refused to let me participate in martial arts because I wouldn’t be able to defend myself supposedly, saying my younger brother would protect me, even though he always runs from confrontation. The worst was getting the “oh we are afraid no one will love him because he is deaf.” That one hurt a lot. There’s so much more from the subtle to the obvious. My mother has always been a gas lighter. I’ve just become more aware of it and disgusted by it. It’s always been oh I didn’t say that or oh you’re putting words in my mouth or oh you misheard it. I’ve hated it my whole childhood. I’m so tired of it but it was whatever since it was just me. But… now she’s been attacking my SO with bs claims of she’s being ableist or she treats me different or she is only with me out of pity. She’s the best person to come into my life. The only person who sees me for who I am and always has my back. So that’s the final straw. Since she wants to go after my SO, I intend to put a stop to it and call her out, knowing she will try and gaslight her way out. I’m not looking forwards to it but my SO deserves better. \n",

They went in, saw the retina, and closed it back up, saying it wasn't worth it. My retina was completely unattached and had multiple tears in it and the surgeon said she could reattach it, but it would only last a month and then I would have to go back to the retinal attachment surgery every month. I also will need a glass eye soon, even though she said I was far away from having to get one.   She also said my optic nerve is damaged in the right eye.

I've gotten better over the years, but I can't always understand the movies in theaters 100%, and sometimes I end up asking a family member or friend what was just said. That being said, I tried an assistive device a few years ago where you'd put on these massive headphones with the volume basically increased. That did nothing for me, so I left them alone and continued to watch and understand what I could.Today! After looking on a website, I found out that this particular theater, Regal Cinema, provided devices with closed captioning. Since I'd be seeing a movie with a ton of noise and such, I decided to give it a try. They ended up being glasses with closed captioning that showed up on the lenses throughout the movie.

I've never asked for assistance and haven't had any problems. Last week I was traveling to France with a connecting flight at London's Heathrow airport.  While in the air, the British Airways flight crew called ahead to let the airport know I needed assistance at Heathrow. Assistance I never requested. When I got off the plane I was put on a cart and driven to a holding room. The attendant took my plane ticket from me and had me sit down. I asked if I could leave and was told to wait until my flight was assigned a gate. At which point, I would be accompanied to my plane.    This is how, for the first time in my life, I became a ward of the state. The holding room had comfortable chairs and a nice bathroom. Not a bad jail as jails go. But I had wanted to shop in the sky mall and get a coffee. Like I do in every other airport I've ever been to in my adult life. Eventually, a family member texted to say they were on the ground and I told them to come get me. It was so humiliating to have them see me being treated like a child and have to save me from, apparently, myself. A week later, on my return flight, I got into several arguments with Heathrow staff about not needing assistance. This worked until security where a guard told me that what I was asking for, self-determination while disabled, just wasn't done. I was disabled, I would be helped. I did convince him not to send me to handicap jail. Instead, a minder followed me around while I shopped, like I was a child or a political dissident. I even made him wait for me while I drank a pint.  There are times when I need assistance. When that happens, I ask for it. To assume that I *need* assistance is insulting. Heathrow was so intent on helping me it never bothered to ask if I needed help. And in helping me they tied up personnel who could have helped others who did need it. In my future trips to Europe, I will try to avoid Heathrow and British Airlines whenever possible.  \n",

      "Profoundly deaf people with tattoos, how has it affected your ability to get a job if at all? I already have one tattoo covering one whole shoulder but with $400 saved up for the holidays, told my hearing mom I was planning on a half-sleeve, but she got so worked up (to a level I honestly don't think was warranted, even if her concerns are/were valid) telling me *to think of my future* and how I won't get hired.For background, I'm an aspiring student looking into graphics design, getting an Associate's degree right now before transferring. I'll probably have to take a secondary job as a back-up though but admittedly I don't know what field. But seeing that most or all of graphics/web designers work from home or have flexible work hours... well... I'm not sure how to take her strongly worded criticisms. She told me I won't be able to work for Disney, and tbh I find that a bit extreme if true (since again, tattoo's can still be covered up if there is not a lot of it) but I'm not interested in that company. What do I do? My disability and semi-muteness already hold me back, and I know this, but after returning to college I've had a sudden boost of confidence and drive to actually get out there despite societal hindrances.  \n",

      "Check out our Kickstarter for blind accessible interactive audio games! Hey guys!So my name is Anthony Russo, and I'm a recent graduate of WPI's interactive media and game development program. While I was at WPI, I focused my studies on accessible games and, specifically, how to make games for people who are blind or partially blind. I did research and interviews at the Perkins School in Massachusetts, and wrote a paper on how developers today should be approaching accessible games for the blind. I just launched a Kickstarter campaign for Grail to the Thief, an interactive audio adventure for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux that can be played using only sound, without the need for visuals. The game has been designed with the needs of the blind in mind but is also designed to be enjoyed by everyone. My goal was to deliver an exciting, immersive experience in which the player will always be fully aware of what is happening through the use of voice-overs, sound effects, ambient sound and music.Let me know if you have any questions or comments. I just thought I'd let you guys know! If you like it tell your friends! Feel free to contact me with any feedback. Anthony RussoFor All To Play LINK \n",

      "Art for a Visually Impaired Family Member Hi all! I hope this is the right sub for my question, and if not, please direct me!So I am an artist by passion. I largely work in 2D mediums, mostly drawing, printmaking, and digital work. I love making drawings and prints for family and friends as gifts. My grandma has always been wonderfully supportive of my artwork and always asks to see it. Unfortunately, she has macular degeneration, and after years of the condition remaining largely unchanged, her vision is declining, fast. She is unable to recognize faces from a distance away, struggles seeing photos, and is now phasing out of reading. It has advanced severely in the last year, and she likely will lose her vision entirely soon. She still gifts me art supplies and asks to see what I do with them, and is amazingly supportive. But I'm struggling, because art is such a visual medium, and I don't know how to connect with her through art right now. I would love to make something that she can connect with and not worry about seeing (she's struggling with pride as well. She doesn't want to ask for help in anything or admit she cannot see something because she's had to take care of herself since she was a child). I want to do this sensitively and not come across as rude or overcompensating. Do you all have any recommendations of how I might be able to connect with her over art? It's something we both share a passion for and I don't want to lose that connection, but also don't want to make her uncomfortable by presenting pieces she cannot distinguish. I was thinking of sharing some print blocks with her because those have indents where material has been carved away, but I'm not sure if that would connect right. Thank you all in advance! \n",

I was hoping someone here could help with this problem that seems like it should have some great solutions out there, but we haven't been able to find any.  We are looking for a handheld device that can run a chat problem for one of our deaf associates. On the surface it seems like it should be an easy solution, but we are having a problem finding something that meets all of our needs.  Because of the environment, everything we've tried has fail.Here is the list of requirements and why:* Needs to be pocket sized or wrist mounted.  This is a large warehouse and people move around it all the time.  Our user will not be be sitting at a computer. * Has to have some sort of chat program we can interface from a computer.  Supervisors will need to be able to sit at a computer and send messages to this device in real time so no phone to phone programs.* Wifi enabled and won't shut off the wifi to save power (i'm looking at you android).  All of the chat programs we have tried loose connections with android devices as they move from access point to access point.* Some sort of vibration circuit to notify the user that there is a message for them.  This place is fast moving and  there are flashing lights everywhere. * Preferable not a phone, this device will not leave the building and won't get a phone signal anyway.* Bonus---- scale-able. We hired a second Deaf person this week and have 2-3 more starting within two weeks.I know this seems like it shouldn't be a problem finding anything, but we have been chasing our tails on this for a long time now.

      "Deaf Versions of Classic Children's Stories Hi everyone. Recently, I discovered that there were Deaf versions of classic children's stories, such as \"Goldlilocks and the Three Bears\" and \"The Three Little Pigs\". The endings of the Deaf versions tend to be those that showcase the strife that the Deaf community has to deal with when interacting with the the hearing world.For example, in the Deaf version of \"Goldilocks\", the three bears are deaf, and Goldilocks is hearing. At the end of the story, when the bears find Goldilocks sleeping in the bed that was *just right*, Goldilocks brushes it off, and says, \"Don't worry, I'm an interpreter!\" The moral of the story is that hearing interpreters take advantage of the Deaf community.In \"The Three Little Pigs\", the three pigs are deaf, and the wolf is hearing. When the wolf visits each pig's house, he yells at them, but the pigs don't understand, since they can't understand his speech. In turn, the wolf doesn't sign either. For the first two scenes, the pigs get eaten. However, during the last scene, the pig calls the police on the wolf, who gets locked away for many years. The wolf, incarcerated, decides to take sign language classes, returns to the last pig's house, and, together, they become best friends. I believe the moral of the story is that conflicts between hearing and Deaf people would be better resolved if hearing people learn to sign.Have you guys heard of these versions? Are such stories passed down in the Deaf community, or are they slightly different depending on the storyteller? In addition, are there other versions you would like to share? I tried doing a Google search on Deaf versions of classic children's stories, but nothing came up. Thanks!Edit: a typo \n",

      "Has a hearing artist ever creatively incorporated asl without offending the community? Sia was negatively criticized for putting her interpreter in mime, snl's parody of that NYC interpreter was demeaning, hearing YouTube \"sign song\" sensations are called out for reappropriation. I agree with all of these reactions but am wondering, is it possible to creatively incorporate asl creatively (not just for accessibility) in a way that's respectful? I think it is but I can't think of any examples of people who have done it. I ask because my friend came to me wanting advice on how to do her next video in sign language. I told her it's dangerous to simply decide to sign your song because you think asl is performance art. I'm going to encourage her include deaf signers, and get a translation from them, but in addition to that is there anything else that would help? \n",

I am a deaf pregnant woman and I am wondering how many deaf pregnant people have written about their interpreter needs in their birth plan?My birth plan is currently 4 pages long and almost a page of that is dedicated to what my spouse and I want/need in terms of interpreting services. We have already requested that we DO NOT want the use of VRI (video relay interpreting) unless labor begins after 9:00PM (knowing that a live interpreter may not be accessible later at night) but that the hospital must make an active attempt at contacting an interpreter ASAP. We also requested for TWO interpreters with on call service for a third (in case of a long labor/delivery). We need two interpreters because there are TWO deaf clients (me and my spouse) and After the baby is born, typically nurses will take the baby into another room for testing and if my spouse follows them, he will need access to communication as well as I (who will be staying in the recovery room unable to move).Just wondering if any deaf people have had Positive experiences giving birth and having access to interpreters. \n",

      "Help with mini-research on best practices for learning ASL in Schools for the Deaf (ASL classrooms vs Integrating ASL in content areas) Hello, /r/deaf, first time poster here!  If I am not in the right place, feel free to point me there!I am a graduate student studying education for the deaf.  I am doing some research for myself (not for a grade, not for a class, just out of sheer curiosity) and I am finding it to be a bit difficult because a lot of the search words I use are common \"buzz words\".I am trying to see if there is a difference how well ASL (as a language) is acquired between:A) Having direct lessons in just ASL in a classroom (e.g., teaching ASL grammar, non-manual signals, phonology/morphology, general vocabulary signs directly; having a class devoted to ASL on the same frequency as a regular/extracurricular class).as opposed toB) Integrating ASL with what is taught in the classroom (e.g., using ASL to teach a science class about simple machines - introducing content and signs simultaneously; a Bi-Bi approach to learning).I am particularly looking at the Elementary/Primary level at schools for the deaf that at least use ASL in instruction (either Bi-Bi or total ASL).  If I could get advice on how best to search a database or if anyone knows of any relevant articles and can share, it would be greatly appreciated.Personal bias statement:  I am a proponent of using ASL/Contact Sign (formerly PSE)/Signed English as part of classroom instruction (I plan on teaching English in a Bi-Bi Deaf classroom).  I also advocate having an ASL class period.  If there are English classes that teach specifically English, then there should also be ASL classes that teach specifically ASL.  I also realize that I need to either find evidence to support my beliefs or change my beliefs to whatever evidence supports otherwise, hence this personal mini-research project.The only thing I've really found that are relevant (and forgive my poor citing skills, this is more informal than anything else) are:*Teachers' perceptions of the use of ASL phonological instruction to develop ASL and English literacy in an ASL/English bilingual preschool* by Peter Crume, 2011 (Dissertation) - States that specialists may be beneficial if they rotate in/out of each classroom; higher phonological awareness leads to better understanding of language (not exactly an answer to my question, but still important to know); literature reviews suggests that due to transference, for  deaf children who are learning ASL as their primary language, they should theoretically  be able to transfer over their deeper level skills of their ASL to learning English and vice versa (p. 42) (while this doesn't necessarily point out which method of instruction is best, it does imply that the more ASL the child knows, the quicker it is to pick up English and vice versa); teachers studied believed that there should be more of a distinction between ASL and English (p. 90). \n",

I am a 20 year old Design Engineering student at a University in London - hoping to create a genuinely useful product for an underserved group of people as part of our 20 week project.An area I’ve been keen to look into is the **challenges and opportunities associated with deaf women’s experiences from the antenatal to postnatal stage**. An initial idea I had was wondering whether deaf expectant-mothers could be allowed to ‘hear’ or feel their baby’s heartbeat in some way through the design of a specialist device? However, I appreciated this may not be the main concern of deaf mothers (or even an issue at all).*Alternatively, what are some issues you faced when carrying and raising a child as a deaf mother or deaf parent? Do you feel as though healthcare professionals could have provided you a better experience and understanding at those times? Are there products and devices around your home used in early infancy childcare which were far too inaccessible as a deaf person?*I’d appreciate it if you took even 30 seconds to vent your frustrations, or even tell me what went well!

      "Alternative communication services overseas for an upcoming conference? Limited budget + only one interpreter available. Ideas and suggestions are appreciated. Hey y'all! I am Deaf and I work for a non-profit organization overseas in a country where my objectives are to work with local schools and governments in developing all aspects of Deaf Education and rights for local Deaf people including a right to have interpreters. (No ADA, no official interpreting agencies, no Deaf centers, no NAD here). However, we have a week-long conference coming up for all of my workers to discuss about our projects (it'll be sessions talking about safety, what the organization's goals are, etc, etc - typical dull sessions) and, beforehand, we were able to obtain local interpreters who are knowledgeable with local sign languages or have some experiences with interpreting for our previous conferences. But not this time. Only one will be available so I am currently looking into remote alternative communication services that will provide top tier communication access on the level. The conference will have high speed internet and I will have my own laptop. Keep in mind, I'm in a country where no ADA exists and only have a limited budget to work with (the exact figure number of the budget is unknown). So far I have looked into:* *ACS* (Alternative Communication Services) for CART options. Its price is too high for our non-profit organization. The CART service costs 120 dollars per hour... 8 hours in the day =  980 dollars. 980 dollars x 5 days of the conference = $4,800. (Jesus, it is 24 times more than my monthly stipend...) Know any similar service for a fraction of price? * *VRI.* Does anyone know any reliable VRI service that is affordable for the budget? Or has anyone personally experienced using it before?* *Speech-to-text apps*. Transcense and Dragon seem like the ideal apps although I know they will not be 100% effective but at least, it will be better than nothing. Any thoughts on it?* *Last options?* My organization always has provided powerpoints and other documents to fill me in when the interpreter is absent or unavailable. Sometimes, I would communicate with everyone via laptops and some know basic sign language but none are fluent enough to interpret. I truly despise helping people for help... I had a thought that I could ask my fellow workers to type up the sessions word by word on our laptops (they were more than willing to help but I hate to ask too much from them so I am looking for every other option before this one). What are your other personal experiences? Just troop through it and do something useful during the time? At least, I'm looking forward to this conference anyway because I'll have some hot water to shower with, eat real nice hot meals that isn't rice and veggies or oatmeal for few months straight, and some wine to drink.

He's very nice and probably would be cool if I tried to communicate more with him.

I'd love to have your input about this, as I think nobody better than you to know about this :)thanks a lotPS: another thing that has been bothering me is that as I'm not 100% certain he uses sign language (I've never seen him or his family use it, but I usually only see him alone) if I try to use it with him and he doesn't that it can come across badly...  \n",

      "Feel weird about using my cane Hello all. I wanted to ask here if any others ever feel any stigma around using their cane?For context, I have retinitis pigmentosa and around 10 degrees of vision. My central vision is still there, although I need glasses and have cataracts developing.I can usually get around pretty well without the need for a cane. But sometimes I prefer to use it, mainly so I don't have to worry about bumping into people or walking down busy streets and having to deal with crowds.My issue is, because I still have functional central vision, I feel weird about using a cane. As stated above, it does give me sense of safety—knowing that people are aware of me, and not feeling a need to apologise when bumping someone. But, because I can see where I'm going, there's a small voice in my head telling me people think I'm a fraud.To be clear, I'm in no way embarrassed about using my cane. In fact, I actually enjoy being able to part the seas of people on crowded footpaths.

      "Deaf Panel Hi r/Deaf,I'm working on a personal project of collecting questions from ASL students and ITP students that they would like to ask Deaf people and compiling a list that will eventually become interviews over Google Hangouts and be uploaded to YouTube.  Over the past month, I've been spending time chatting with people learning to become interpreters and have gone to RID conferences, partially in an effort to see the big picture behind what I do for a living.  The results have been eye opening for both my wife (Deaf) and myself.  At every level there seems to be either an apathy toward or lack of understanding the culture of Deafness and--in many cases--a forgetfulness of those who work with Deaf that the Deaf are the consumers and we are paid to use their language, their way, in order to strive toward equal access.  I believe that a large part of the reason this isn't happening as effectively as it should be is because many ITPs are producing interpreters who have little or no understanding of the people whom they are employed to serve.  This is not to say that all, or even most, interpreters and teachers of the Deaf are crap at their jobs.  In fact, I was fortunate enough to make some great contacts whom I hope will become friends over this last month.  There were just more people who fit into the mold I described above than made me comfortable. So, if any you who are Deaf are willing to be interviewed over Hangouts, let me know; your help would be greatly appreciated.  If any of you who are hearing (ASL students, interpreters, etc.) have questions you would like to see asked in the interviews, please let me know.Thanks for your time. \n",

      "BAHA 5 help Okay, so some quick background--I've had single-sided deafness since ibwaa thirteen. About a month and a half ago, my ENT told my about the BAHA 5 Attract, and I signed up to give it a shot. Unfortunately, though, I'm only their second patient to take part in this process, so we've run into a couple bumps. Bump one--my skin's apparently too thick for the number three magnet, so they had to order me a number five and a number six.Bump two--my sound process seems incapable of giving me adequate volume without sounding too tinny and whiny. I've had people whisper near my processor, and I can't make out what they're saying. I've tried taking a phone call on it, and it's so quiet, I may as well not bother. I've even tried listening to music and watching movies on it, and I couldn't make out half of what was being said with the overhead fan running. So my question is, does ANYONE know why I'm having this issue, and if so, do you have a solution? Because my audiologists seem like they've just given up on fixing the issue, writing it off as a limitation of the device.Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks.  \n",

      "Got my cane; already seeing results in first two days! Thanks so much for everyone's feedback!          My first morning with the cane, I went to the 7-11 store I always go to in the morning on my way to work. It's always packed and that morning was no different. I walked over to the iced coffee as I do every morning, got my cup and as I slid it under the \"mocha\" tap, I noticed some kind of things taped to the dispenser handles. As I leaned in to see what they said, I heard a voice behind me say \"mocha\" as I turned he said \"the other one's vanilla\". Turns out the little paper simply said \"press down\" but I was thrilled at this random assistance, even if it wasn't exactly what I needed at the time. I made sure to say \"thank you\".          Today, I was walking across the street to get lunch. As I exited the building, a vehicle was pulling through the parking lot. It stopped. This is always the worst for me. I can see the vehicle, but I never know if the driver is waving me on or not. I don't want to just walk out so when they stop, I usually try to look away until they go (and I always feel like an asshole, especially if they *were* waving me on). Today though a guy behind me said \"go ahead\" and then quickly said \"wait\" as both he and the driver realized simultaneously that I couldn't see if they were waving or not.          I've also noticed strangers tend to say \"Hi\" more when they see me and certainly seem friendlier versus the usual expressionless silence of stranger passing.          I know this all sounds trivial, but I'm pretty excited to see such a dramatic change so suddenly. Again, thank you all so much! \n",

      "[Math]: Can anyone help a blind guy learn matrix inversion using the LU decomposition method? I'm posting this here because I think that people visiting this sub are more likely to have the predisposition required to help me.I'm building a [very ambitious and equally useless project]( because I have nothing else to do.  My project is a mix of a kind of operating system kernel, game engine, and ultimately a game itself targeting a bare metal Raspberry Pi 4.  The kernel part is pretty much done, with only an audio driver missing, so now I'm working on a huge milestone which will be adding some gesture recognizers (already implemented in my local repository), building a simple 3D software renderer (working on it now), implementing a basic 3D scene tree (to be done), and laying the foundation for an Entity Component System architecture (also to be done).  Since part of the reason why I'm doing this is learning, I'm implementing everything from scratch in Rust and assembly without any third-party code, so please do not suggest using libraries.At the moment I'm trying to implement a Transform type which is a 4x4 matrix with some common operations used in game engines like translation, rotation, scale, inversion, transposition, and multiplication, and while looking for ways to reduce the number of computations required to compute the inverse of a matrix, I read that there's a method called LU decomposition that is faster than the method that I learned still with sight which requires roughly 500 calculations.The problem is that VoiceOver on MacOS, the only system that I have access to, is a pile of crap especially when it comes to reading math on the web, either becoming unresponsive, taking ages to read a single item, or making the cursor loop infinitely preventing me from reading the rest of the article.  I've also tried listening to YouTube videos but that didn't help either since the authors assume that the audience is sighted, so unless I can find someone to teach me how to invert a matrix using the LU decomposition method I'll have to implement the only method I know which is quite slow.  Therefore I'm here to ask whether anyone would be willing to provide me with high level instructions on how to invert a 4x4 matrix using the LU decomposition method over private messages.  I ask for high level instructions because it's important to me to understand the concepts, which is something that I don't get from reading or using third-party code.Should anyone volunteer to help me, I must warn you that I'm a high school drop-out with a very weak formal math background, and that pretty much everything I know about math at the moment I learned by myself on the Internet until over 8 years ago, before I lost my sight.Thanks in advance!PS: If you volunteer, please announce it publicly in a comment so that I can publicly acknowledge your offer.  This prevents leaving me in a position where I have to privately choose who is going to teach me in case several people come to my assistance.  Ideally I wouldn't mind the whole thing to be public since it could help others in the same situation in the future; the only reason why I'm asking for private assistance is because doing this publicly would result in a very deeply nested thread. \n",

      "I’m really confused on my hearing situation… So about 2 years ago I went to Hawaii and had a pretty bad cold/ ear infection in my right ear,(my left ear is perfectly fine just the right one that’s messed up. Eustachian tube swollen shut and my ear clogged with wax with an inflamed eardrum. Well eventually I cleared some of it to the point where the pressure equalized in my middle ear and something happened, all I know is that my ear felt like it was being stabbed with a giant needle, after that I couldn’t hear in it for about a week and my hearing slowly returned. Went to the doctor and they said take nasal steroid medication and that helped a bit, hearing never fully returned and I don’t think it will. As of recent my hearing has seemingly been in and out, conversations and certain sounds are hard to hear on my right side but having around half to 60% functionality helps. I decided to start taking ASL and now am pretty interested in the Deaf community. Does anyone think I can identify with the Deaf community at this point as a hard of hearing person? I posted a similar question on the same topic a while ago and want just a bit more answers from people just so I can reach a better consensus. Thanks! \n",

      "Becoming blind I wanted to ask you kind folks a few questions as it seems to me that I (can still see but) am suffering from approaching vision lossSo yeah, about 11 months ago I chose to end my life by overdosing on two boxes of ibuprofen. It caused me a bit of discomfort, and immediately blurred my eyesight so that I had to begin wearing glasses for the first time..My first question is: anyone know what on earth ibuprofen did to damage my vision permanently?I'm afraid I've been unable to get a doctor who can give it to me straight or honestly. As time has gone on, I've been witnessing the fall of flashing lights, the appearances if grey veils across my previously perfect vision some 10 months after I OD'd and the attack of multiple shadows, more largely on my left hand vision but also the other sideAs time has gone on my vision has tilted so that I'm naturally seeing less out of my left eye..Over the past few days, I'm seeing more right than left and I'm experiencing the complete disappearance of image of the outside world in favor of flying black sheets and objects. My eyes are a little red, and some of the red veins are more prominent than ever. I tried to book in with an optician, but the nurses minding me on the psych ward won't allow me to leave, so I'm pretty much stuck here with my symptoms, rapidly deteriorating sight, and whatever advice you folks can offer me.So yeah that's all I want to ask of those of you in the know: does any of this sound fixable? I live in the UK so I have the NHS as far as treatment is concerned, money isn't an issue. I am a little confused however as to exactly just what the ibuprofen did to my eyes to make me experience this and whether the sort of damage it has done can be reversed.What do you reckon, if anything?

      "Is Deaf considered Special needs? **DISCLAIMER: My intention is not to offend anyone, and I truly apologize in advance if I do offend anyone. I simply want to gain clarity on this question that has bugged me for a long time.**Hi everyone! I am a deaf person myself, and I have heard some people call me special needs and said that deafness is considered special needs as we are disabled and rely on other people for several things such as making phone calls etc. This has confused me a lot because I thought special needs usually meant people who needs extra requirements in education and in other areas due to physical or intellectual or behavioural disabilities and cannot be fully 100% independent.  (This means people with Autism, or Down Syndrome and so on). Yes people consider being Deaf as a disability, (I apologize this as many deaf people hate being identified as disabled including myself), BUT there are so many deaf people that are incredibly independent and many deaf people are not cognitively, or intellectual or physically disabled.Therefore, that is why I ask if  Deafness is a special needs or not?Thank you! \n",

      "Thinking about getting a cochlear implant - would like to know your experiences with them Hello, all! I've been seriously considering getting a cochlear implant for the past year and have done a large amount of research on cochlear implants and how to get one. However, the internet is very lacking in people's testimonials about getting a cochlear implant and the Facebook groups I joined and asked about it pretty much ended up in a war over which brand was best... So I figured that maybe Reddit was the best chance I had to find out a little bit more. All the threads I've seen are somewhat outdated so I thought that it wouldn't hurt to post a new thread pertaining to getting a cochlear implant.Of course, I do have a few specific questions that I would love for you guys to answer, but if you just want to share your experiences about it, that's fantastic too.What pros or cons do you see with having a cochlear implant?What was the process you used to go ahead with getting one? (For example, did you go to an audiologist or did you go to an ENT or what?)If you have a hearing aid in one ear and a cochlear implant in the other (which is what I will most likely be doing if I get a CI), what are your experiences with using both like?And one more! What did your audiologist do to determine that you were an eligible candidate for a cochlear implant?Thanks in advance! (Also, I should mention--if you have a negative opinion and don't have any valid input, keep it to yourself. I've already heard it all and I would really appreciate having an open dialogue about this.)Oh, and I forgot to tell you a little bit about myself--I'm 22 and I've been deaf since birth, and I have profound hearing loss in both ears. However, I only wear a hearing aid in my left ear because my right ear doesn't hear anything with a hearing aid. I know both English and ASL and can read lips and speak very well.

I will keep my Windows laptop and most likely convert it into a Linux machine.I'm still not decided if I should go for a Mac or just a Windows laptop. I've never used a Mac before and I wanted to reach out to Mac users to share my use case and ask if the apps I use on a daily basis are accessible on the Mac, if the user-experience is comporable to Windows and if there are maybe better alternatives.Here are the programs I use on Windows on a daily basis. Can someone please give me an overview how they work on Mac?Programming in Python and C++. I use VS Code for this. Next semester I will start learning Java. For this I will most likely use VS Studio. I've heard good things about ExCode and TextMate on the Mac. I also want to start getting into iOS development.Command line to SSH into Linux. I also use WSL to have Ubuntu on my laptop. How accessible is the command line on Mac?Cloud services: OneDrive, Dropbox and Google Drive. I have a paid OneDrive account. How well does OneDrive and the rest, but mainly OneDrive integrate with Mac? Can you set it up so that files from documents back-up on OneDrive? Is there a way to get a file explorer experience on the Mac, or do you need to use the OneDrive app to upload and download files? This is really important since the Mac I will get will be 256GB and I have 1TB storage on OneDrive. I use it a lot on Windows.For emails I use Thunderbird. What is a Mac alternative? I use Protonmail as my main email and I need third-party email integration. Is the stock email app ok for this?I use ProtonVPN. On Windows over all it is not accessible, but the connect-disconnect button is accessible. How is ProtonVPN on Mac?Messaging apps: Discord, Whatsapp on the web and the desktop app, Messenger on the web. How is their accessibility?Microsoft office products, mainly Word and Excel. Also I've recently started using Microsoft Access for work. How is the experience for Word?Google Docs and Sheets. I use them for work on a daily basis.Reaper to record music.With NVDA I use the InstantTranslate add-on.

I'm especially interested in how we could have made the media itself friendlier to vision-impaired readers. Any thoughts welcome. \n",

      "Python programming for blind/visually impaired? I am sighted, but recently I got interested in accessibility and the question how blind computer users could learn programming. When looking around I found that most solutions seem to be very unsatisfying, and I quickly got inspired to try to make the situation better.So I started to design a framework for text-to-speech user interfaces in the Python 3 programming language. It only requires a normal keyboard and headphones or a speaker. That way a cheap one-board computer like the Raspberry Pi is all that is needed to start using and even developing for it.The disadvantage is of course, that any applications have to be written from scratch. The benefit is that the applications can be completely customized for text-to-speech.A custom text editor would be used to write Python programs. By using key strokes the editor can pronounce the code or give orientation hints, like \"line 42, column 8\" or \"line 42, class Contact, def get_mail_address, line 3\".Touch typing is a requirement, but a text-to-speech touch typing tutor/training program would be accessible with only the number keys. In my opinion braille displays with keyboards are not a good idea. The framework may eventually use braille displays, but they are extremely expensive, and not even that standardized. The integrated keyboards seem to be a bit cumbersome for programming. Depending on these devices would limit both the potential blind audience as well as sighted programmers willing to help out.At first the goal would not be to completely replace a working PC setup or Android device, but rather a cheap platform which is easy to tinker with. The main goal is to get users writing their own applications as quickly as possible, and building up from there.A computer running the software can be put together for $70 dollars or less (Raspberry Pi, SD Card, keyboard, headphone, power cable and optionally a wifi stick).The project is in a very early stage, and I would like to hear what other people have to say about the topic. \n",

      "Does anyone here play Multi User Dungeons? Multi User Dungeons or MUDs for short, are generally purely text based, online multiplayer games and a good portion of players are blind. Some MUDs are laid back, while others are virtual worlds with a heavy emphasis on role playing.MUDs number into the many of hundreds, although it does not mean they are all heavily populated. The vast majority are free. Also many of the game clients are free. There are several public websites that showcase them.MUDs come in many varieties of genres like adventure, modern, sci-fi, historical, horror, medieval, etc. Some are based on the works of Lord of the Rings, Discworld, Dragons of Pern, Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. Others are a mix-match of genres or established material. Many communities are accepting of new people and willing to help.  There are screen readers and sound packs that help a blind person play the game.Full Disclosure, I will be linking this thread to r/MUD, as several people are interested in MUDs and the blind community as well.  In fact quite a few blind users come to that thread asking about MUDs in general.So how did you discover MUDs and what are some of your favorite MUDs? I would be happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have that I can about MUDs. Thank you for your time and patience. \n",

      "Best Wrist-Worn Alarm (Clock)? Hi all,  So backstory.. Christmas 2014, I received a Jawbone UP24 from my parents, hoping to focus more on my well being, and while it has helped myself do that.. I use it more for an alarm clock than I do for the rest of the features. I've set three alarms on it so that the first one gently wakes me up, and the two following ones are more for insurance to actually get me up.Fast forward a year and 3 months, and one replacement later... My current one still functions... however it is definitely approaching the end of its life, and I would like to find something that would replace it soon.Being deaf, I do need the vibration alerts, but I am not such a deep sleeper that it doesn't require the Sonic Alert alarm clocks (which I have... however, sharing a three-bed system (bunk beds/lofted third bed means that it'll wake up my siblings as well).I'd also like a wrist one since it's portable and will let traveling be a little easier, in terms of having less things to pack.So any recommendations? Should I get a fitness band, or an actual wristwatch? (Not sure how I'd feel about that, since it took me a couple weeeks to get used to the feel of my Up..)Thank you! \n",

      "Have you ever (or know somebody who has) dated or befriended a fellow deaf person who signed in a different language? I was watching CODA last night for probably the 5th time and God it's such a beautiful film. It peaked my interest again in signing - of course in the film everybody is signing in ASL. But I was wondering if anyone here has ever met or interacted with somebody who signed in a different language (ASL, BSL, LSF, SSL, etc). I know signing is not universal so if you do interact with somebody who signs a different language, I would imagine it's like learning a completely different language then? I'm curious to hear about people's experiences. As a hearing person, it's quite a fun obstacle to try to overcome language barriers by learning to speak a foreign language - but I would imagine it's a similar experience for those who sign. Thanks for your replies :) \n",

      "Getting a second VRS number for work? Hello! I’ve started a new job where I’ll need a work number but I’m their first deaf employee so they’re not sure how things work. I said I could help them look into it.How do they get a work number for me from one of the VRS services or can I request a new number myself? I absolutely do not want to use my personal number and it’s not allowed anyway. Is it also possible to have my VRS ring too while allowing for the hearing phones to ring too when someone calls the general number for my location? Or can I only forward it to my VRS number and it won’t ring for the hearies?They will give me a work device with the VRS app installed on it. I plan to have the device forward calls to my VRS number so they still can text me without having to remember my other number too. Wish there was a VRS service that let you text to the number too but oh well.App-only VRS would be fine but they may want to be open to getting a dedicated device at location too so I’d like to offer that as an alternate option. I think I already have accounts on all of the main providers so may not be able to just get a number on a diff provider 😅We also do get some deaf customers and sometimes they need to make calls so what would be the legality of allowing deaf customers use my device when they need to call? Not all providers have good service at the location so depending on what they have, the connection may be too weak to use VRS hence them potentially having to use a device. If not, I’ll try talk them into having a spare iPad or device with all of the VRS apps pre installed so they can log into their account to make calls.Sorry about the wall of the text but if you need me to clarify anything I can! \n",

      "looking for screen reader for mostly sighted person I have had visual snow & blind spots throughout most of my life. Previously it had been difficult but possible for me to read unassisted. However, I recently had a procedure that induced a stroke-like event and now my visual snow & blind spots have made my reading speed frustratingly slow & headache inducing. I had to drop out of all my classes this semester while I recover from the procedure & learn to adapt to this.  I've messed around with some screen readers and they help a lot but I haven't found one that's meant for someone who is visually impaired but still sighted. I would love a program that just reads highlighted text at a speed that I can quickly change. The Windows & Google Pixel programs make that take forever and make me sit through lots of instructions/voiced controls. I'm sure this is wonderful for blind people but for me it's giving redundant info because I can make out different buttons and stuff.  If anyone has any recommendations I would super appreciate it. Or if anyone knows of subs that might be more relevant to me that would also be super helpful, (I couldn't find an \"r/semisighted\" or an \"r/visuallyimpaired\" sort of thing so sorry if this is the wrong place to be asking for help!!) thank ya \n",

My peripheral vision is pretty much gone and my regular vision is extremely blurry but I can see okay with glasses/contacts.Due to poor peripheral vision, I miss things in front of me, trip over stairs, bump into things - especially under dim lighting. Sometimes as my vision declines, I miss details right in front of me.I have been trying to learn to accept this new reality and embrace the condition, but it's emotionally draining when the first impression people get of me is clumsy!

For those who didn't see it, I asked about the best and worst training centers. This is my current question. So I'm in my 20s and live in Illinois. I'm going to ask my state's voc rehab to pay for my training at a training center out of state because as far as I know there's nowhere that can teach me the skills I would like in Illinois. But my question is, if they refuse, is there anywhere I can go for free? That I do not need a state referral for? Or can get a scholarship for? I'm just thinking of the worst case scenario here. I'm hoping and praying voc rehab will send me somewhere, but if not I'd like to know my options. I'm open to going anywhere really. I'm pretty flexible. Thanks in advance. \n",

At the beginning of my freshman year, I was given a choice. ASL or spanish.

The ASL teacher's daughter was deaf and I feel like I could have gotten a great experience learning from him. Sadly I dont have that option anymore.But im not giving up. Im determined to learn ASL because I have this feeling in my heart that its part of my culture.

It was pulled down by the county a few days ago and given back to me (surprised it took them this long).   I reached out again w a request to place a sign, and they gave the same response.

We’re asking for signatures for a [petition to save the deaf unit.]( folks, I’m reaching out to you for support. My friend has 2 beautiful deaf children who currently get specialised education in London, UK. They attend Laycock primary school in Islington, a mainstream school with a specialist unit that provides education to deaf children.However, with costs rising and enrolment falling, the school is trying to find savings, and the headteacher is proposing cuts targeted at the deaf provision, with key specialist roles likely to be axed. The headteacher’s proposal to just put deaf children from years 4 to 6 into mainstream classes is unacceptable. Many children at the deaf unit have other special needs and would definitely not get the tailored specialised care they so need to keep learning and developing.

He’s 28 and lives with his mom and I’m trying to help him move out but he can’t support himself as a shelf stocker. I have 2 questions, answer one or both please.1: Does anyone know how or what I can say to him to make him either go back to college? 2: what sort of job would require little no education that would be perfect for someone like him. \n",

      "Cochlea Implants Hi,I wonder if we might not create another CI specific subreddit. So far I've only seen yes/no answers here, often without noting the different manufacturers available and their individual pro/cons. Of course the last word is with your acoustician/implant center, but knowing these implants will stay with you/your child for a lifetime and are quite intrusive, I'd value second opinions and users experiences. Your acoustician usually doesn't know how it sounds to you, especially since it varies between patients and even between ears.The hardcoded flairs wouldn't suit me well either. Looking at the values, I'm deaf - but not sign language competent since my hearing was lost gradually over the course of 20 years, starting with a mid-level hearing impairment. It doesn't come close to hearing either. More and more parents are deciding on CIs for their deaf children who probably won't ever learn sign lanuage either, so one might think that this group might continue growing.Also bilateral implantation - especially at the same time - isn't a topic well covered in this subreddit. AFAIR I was one of the first ones being bilaterally implanted in the local hospital which does ca. 40-45 surgerys per year - the bigger remote hospital doing ca. 500 surgeries annually actually didn't want to do that.My choice were Advanced Bionics HiRes 120k implants and the Naida CI Q70 with 3x 230mAh + 1x 110mAh rechargeables each. 35h runtime out of 5x 230mAh due to the left SP using considerably more power. Standard equipment is up to 2x 230mAh plus one small 110mAh (needed for AquaCase (fully waterproofed), in my case only spare in the wallet) or a 170mAh with RF receiver. One charger for 4 batteries per SP is included and can be connected via micro-USB, so whereever you charge your smartphone or have your laptop around, you can charge the batteries as well. The Remote Control is an interesting addon, but the software is quite unstable.Bonus for me was the sound processing technology copied from Phonak hearing aids, with which I had best experience from the past 21 years. Even when officially deaf, Phonaks worked well enough for me to live an independent life for at least 5 more years. The IP57 water- (1 meter depth, 30minutes submersion, of course drying afterwards overnight) and dustproofing was also a requirement since the coastal region I'm living in can soak you to the bones in minutes.I'd appreciate insight from users of other implant types, what their daily handling is like, problems you've experienced etc. Would anyone be interested in my sound notes? For example I've attended an organ concert in a church ca. 4 months after first fitting and was analyzing the sound more than I was listening to the music. Feel free to criticize any misspellings/misuse of words as I am not a native english speaker and started learning it when I was already pretty much deaf. \n",

P.S. although the answers to some of my questions could be found through research, my class requires me to actually ask these questions myself and get responses. Thank you for your cooperation. * 1) What influenced your decision to join the Deaf community? * 2) What makes the Deaf community different and unique compared to other subcultures/communities?* 3) Which and How has technology(s) enabled you to communicate effectively with the hearing as well as deaf/hard-of-hearing peers?* 4) Has the mainstream perception of Deaf communities changed in light of advancements of communication technology? * 5) How do you think the media plays a part in portraying Deaf communities?* 6) What is your stance on cochlear implants? How about hearing aids?* 7) How do hearing parents of deaf children react to the tough decisions that is placed on them? (ex. whether to allow cochlear implants or not for their kids)* 8) Do you think that there is a sense of resistance by the Deaf community against the mainstream society?* 9) Do you think there is a stigma because being deaf or hard-of-hearing is not “normal”?* 10) What would you like to happen in terms of technology advancement that would be acceptable by the mainstream stream society as well as the Deaf communities?* 11) What would cause someone to exit this community? How do you view someone who leaves the community for those reasons?* 12) Finally, what is one question that you get asked by a hearing person that irritates you? \n",

      "Should I look into hearing aids? So for context, I'm 25 and haven't gotten my hearing check in a long time. When I was a freshman in high school the Dr told me I would probably need hearing aids by the time I turned 40. I can still hear, but I can tell it's not as well as I used to be able to. I heavily rely on subtitles to fully hear and understand what is happening when watching TV. At work, I only hear the alarms that are loud and sometimes miss when patients are calling out for help.I have a pair of earbuds that allow ambient sound to come through if I want it to and I actually hear a lot better with them in. And my boyfriend has a set of over the ear headphones that are used when shooting guns. They amplify sounds but cancel out the loud bang. I feel like I'm actually able to enjoy the world if I have them on and that's when I realize how quiet it usually is for me.Are there any products that work in this way, that are fairly cheap that I could buy that have a long battery life, say 12 hours or so?

So we no longer have to beg usually uncaring developers to make their products accessible for the blind.Also, an AI could learn from your behavior and using that data, try do make things easier for you. For example, it sees that whenever you open a particular news website the first thing you do is pressing 3 to move to the first headline. So after a while it asks you, do you want to automatically move to the first level 3 heading after you open this website? And much more useful stuff.

I want to learn how I can do better by the Deaf community themselves.That being said, I have been thinking about the word “dumb” and it’s modern uses as well as its historical connotation.  Prior to my learning ASL and about Deaf culture, I did not even know that the word “dumb” actually meant “unable or unwilling to speak.”  Growing up, I had always heard it used as a way to call someone dense.  I am grateful now to be a little more educated.Now I understand this has ramifications of its own.  It is not right to convert a word that historically had some sort of clinical meaning over a group of people at one point into an insult.  Nor is using the term “deaf and dumb” at all acceptable.  Now that I have some knowledge on the history of this word, I have gotten rid of it from my vocabulary.I guess my question is: do you find this word to be offensive even when not used in the context of deafness/speech ability?  I am asking because this word seems to be extremely ubiquitous in conversation among many people, yet I don’t think people understand it’s origin.  Should I be doing the best I can to prevent myself as well as others who I hear using the word from using it in the future?  Again, I apologize if this is at all insensitive.  To my Deaf friends, please let me know what I can do better going forward. \n",

      "Picked up a cell phone for my mom. It's a pre-paid phone.  A Samsung Galaxy J1.  It has a tactile button on the bottom that, when you hold it for 2 or 3 seconds, it takes you to the \"OK, Google\" prompt.  This seems to work so long as the phone is powered on and awake, no matter what other app or menu item is active on the phone.  So that's definitely going to be helpful for her.I'm setting it up with Google Voice, so she can use it off the WiFi in the house (ergo, no added monthly bill).  Now, I can add whatever contacts she needs in gmail, and they'll be there for her to use.The phone itself was $99.  I had to pay a $35 activation fee, a $45 fee for the first month of service (which is, unfortunately mandatory), and then tax, of course.  All told, it was $199 out of the store, but with no further monthly fees, and no contract.I still have to finish setting it up for her, and see how she likes it.  The tricky part might be setting up both the Google number, and the house phone to ring simultaneously on both numbers.  One or the other is easy enough, but doing it on both might cause some sort of loop that creates a rift in time and space.  We'll see.The reason for all of this, of course, is to facilitate mom's ability to dial friends, family and local businesses without having to remember all the phone numbers.Anyway, just wanted to put this idea out there in case this might help anyone else.  I'm sure many of you have your own systems that are way beyond this, but for any who might be looking for ideas, this is mine. \n",

      "Should I apply for a scholarship from AG Bell Association? I grew up oral with cochlear implants and started learning ASL in my junior year in high school by taking classes at a nearby college and going to Deaf gatherings. Recently, I got my acceptance email from Cal State University-Northridge and I know for sure that I'm going there because of their mass population of Deaf/Hard-Of-Hearing students and their dorms accommodating to their needs.However, when my teacher of the Deaf (who's main speciality is the Oral-Auditory approach) showed me scholarships for people like us, one of them is from the AG Bell Association. I immediately thought back to what I learned what Alexander Graham Bell did to us when I read the name.I researched the organization, who claimed in some articles they wrote that they \"don't discourage\" ASL and are merely just supporting those who choose the oral path. Yet when I checked articles that are not from them, they talk mostly about promoting the oral approach and rarely ASL. I even found that they tried to get a Pepsi commercial in a Super Bowl that showed signing in 2008, and I can't tell if they had changed ever since then or not.I feel like I'm betraying my heritage by taking the scholarship and when I talked about this to my teacher of the Deaf, they said that while the organization may be founded on less than ideal principles and had a bad history, they changed and merely want to help others.Should I go down the pragmatic path and apply for it or I should not? \n",

      "\"HELP! I need advice on dating a deaf girl.\" The UPDATE you guys deserve. Sorry I haven't written an update, I've been busy and wanted to know for sure what to write first to avoid sparking false hope.So she had to cancle on our beach date because she had to study for driving theory, so we went to get sushi on this tuesday. We agreed to dress [fancy]( She had hinted that she liked roses so I got her a bunch. At first when I met with her talking as a little slow and I was hesitating as I wasn't sure how much she could understand and we were walking to the sushi joint. Turns out she understood about 90% of what I said. We ordered a huge portion of [sushi]( Communicating wasn't that hard, I even learned how to sign \"you look good\" before our date and showed her. We talked about basic things, she seemed like she was having a good time and smiling all the time. I insisted on paying afterwards, we walked back to the center, hugged and said goodbye.The next few days she seemed quite occupied, but so was I with work and other things. I told her I would like to see her again, she said she will have to see later this week if she has time.last couple of days I noticed she has been ignoring my messages, leaving them unanswered and giving me short responses. I texted her something along the lines of \"if you're not interested in me you can just tell me\". After that she admitted that she wasn't really feeling it. I thanked her for opening up to me and giving me a chance (she told me before that she usually doesnt go on many dates).**TL;DR** We went to eat sushi, she wasn't that into me. \n",

      "My 3 Year Old Daughter is Deaf, I Have So Many Questions. After typing this out I realized I just had a huge wall of text so I will stick to a little back story and my biggest question.  My daughter who was a preemie failed her initial hearing test when she was born.  We didn’t think much of it since the Dr.’s wrote it off as a preemie thing and probably nothing to worry about.  At three months old my daughter finally got in to see an audiologist.  This is when we discovered that she had “significant” hearing loss.  We were completely caught off guard by this but since then we have learned that a good amount of my father’s side of the family has hearing loss.  My father passed away when I was young and we lost touch with them.  We are very fortunate to live close to CID (Central Institute for the Deaf).  My daughter has been going there since she was three months old and they have been a wonderful resource.  Along with this we were part of a state program called First Steps.  Through them we had weekly visits from a deaf educator who was also amazing and not only helped my daughter but helped us with what to do what to be prepared for and so on.  Now that my daughter has turned 3yrs old she is no longer eligible for First Steps. Now to my question.My daughters hearing loss fluctuates greatly but as of right now they say she has moderate in her left ear and moderate – sever in her right ear.  What we don’t understand is that with or without her hearing aids she seems like she hears appropriately.  The other day we were at the park and it was noisy.  She didn’t have her hearing aids on because we were going swimming.  She was walking a bit ahead of us and we said something to her in a normal speaking voice.  She turned around and responded with an appropriate answer.  This was not a one off occurrence.  She is like this all the time.  At one point we weren’t even having her wear her hearing aids because she didn’t act like she needed them.  CID scolded us and said that she may be hearing us and able to respond but she is not hearing properly and it will affect her developing speech.  Does this seam right to you.  Can you explain it in a way that might make sense to a hearing person?   \n",

I am not allergic to help, and I do ask when I need it, but only when I need it.The problem I am having right now is taking pictures of items I am wanting to sell online. I do this on the side to make extra money. Currently, my wife takes the pics when she feels like it, and that works out okay, but I'd rather do it myself. The more of this job I do, the better, and it makes the whole process faster, because my wife often takes a while to get around to taking the pics then transferring them to my laptop. I want to get the item photographed and on the internet the same day I bring it home if possible. I have a few ideas of my own, but I am interested to see what you folks think. I have read up on blind photography, but all I get about the actual process is a very vague description which involves a sighted partner who helps. It leaves me wondering, do they simply set everything up and, as I said before, let them press the button? Then, there's a lot of artsy fluff about changing our perception and \"how we see the world\", helping us to see things from a different perspective, bla bla bla. None of this helps me. \n",

      "interested in writing better subtitles I am hearing. I've noticed a few posts on here that complain about the lacking subtitles on Netflix, YouTube, etc. I've been watching *Peep Show* with the captions on and I'm noticing just how bad they are- it's as if they have to limit the jokes to a certain number of characters, and so much is lost. I think if I had an opportunity to write the captions myself, they'd be a lot closer to the actual material, and with the proper breaks, the humor could be just as punchy. I'm wondering if you guys can point me toward anyplace where I can get involved with writing better subtitles for YouTube videos and shows? I'm a poet, musician, and a writer, and I think that I could really offer something to the community. I really do my best to put myself in the shoes of others, and being a hearing person, I am appalled at how *boring* the captions are for my favorite comedies- the jokes are ruined by the timing and the wording of almost *everything*. If this sounds patronizing or piteous in any way, that was not my intention at all. **TL:DR;** I am lucky enough to be hearing and have the ability to compare the captions to the audio of videos, and would like to improve upon the boring, poorly timed captions (particularly of comedies). \n",

      "What's your take on deaf peddlers/beggars? Spurned by an experience I had today while eating at a fast food place (in the USA). Not the first time and certainly won't be the last time this has happened to me.  Peddlers typically go in circles, leaving a cheap trinket (usually a pen) with a small card/note attached to it at each table. The note might be either a friendly request for a \"donation\" for the item (I believe this is to circumvent the anti-panhandling laws) or educational in a form of manual alphabets.  The peddler I encountered today used the former along with a cute smiling I-L-Y stamped image, asking for donations to \"support\" his family.Before I continue with my today's experience, I'm interested in what Reddit has to say.  I am pretty sure that deaf peddlers are omnipresent, scattered all over the world, especially in underdeveloped countries.  Also, I am aware of an unfortunate fact that there is a good number of unsavory hearing people seeking extra pity by masquerading as deaf people down on luck (after all, it's not too difficult to impersonate a deaf person). I understand that deaf people have opinions, ranging from outrageous to apathy to supportive (as in hearing people deserve to be duped/taken advantage of!).  So what are deaf/deaf-familiar (surdo-oikeio? koufos-oikeio? Trying to figure a neologism for a non-existent word.) Redditors' thought on this?  \n",

You get the idea.  I love this language.  It's complexity and simplicity all in on package.Then it hit me.  You can curse in any language.  Why not ASL?  One of the guys on the crew is particularly mouthy so I signed to the new guy that said mouthy guy is \"Full of BS.\"  The sign for BS is so hilarious to me, I nearly had to be revived when I watched a video of it.  I though I was going have to revive the new guy when I pulled that phrase on him.  He has this quiet little laugh (and a wicked sense of humor) that make jokes all the more amusing.I've always been uncomfortable around those society would consider to have a disability, yet I've learned so much from this guy.  He's a Harvard professor compared to my spastic signing.  He also saves no time in correcting me, and I appreciate that he's willing to be patient enough to teach me.  \n",

      "Quality of life or a life with medications and sideeffects Hi,Let me first give a little bit of a background story. Two years ago I started having static floaters and lines in my vision when looking at a white desk, wall or the sky. I made an appointment with a optometrist. After a year of nothing and loosing a lot of peripheral vision on mainly my right eye I got referred to a eye clinic and a Ophthalmologists. After endless tests I got the diagnose of npAIR (Autoimmune Retinopathy) without cancer.   Since than I have been constantly at either the eye clinic or Immunologist and my eyes have continued loosing more and more vision on my right as well on my left despite all the endless treatments, promises, appointments, waiting times and now side effects from all the medications. As far as I can tell it slowed to progression down but not into remission. It continues and I am getting tiered to all of it. I have been now on immunosuppressed for about a year as well as high dosage of oral cortison steroids. I start feeling the aftermaths of the medication by not being able to get proper sleep, ankle and knee joint problems, heavy weight gains, mood swings, brain fog, exhausten and tiredness.  I started having a different outlook on life and what it means to be happy even without the ability to see. I always thought without my vision nothing would be worth living for. Sound incredibly dark and depressing I know. But I changed and truly believe that life can be still be amazing, full of surprises, that goals can still be set and achieved, that nothing can hold me back of having a fulfilled life full of happiness as a low vision or blind person. I am not yet fully blind I am far from it I still have very usable vision but I am now visually impaired and I use a ID cane. Currently I stand at a crossroad either to keep my vision longer threw medication, appointments, etc. and the side effects of it or to stop all treatments and let the thing go its course. I was wondering if anyone can relate to this? Did anyone went threw a similar scenario where they just stopped all treatments and chose not to go the medical route? How about others? Would you rather go the medical router or accept it how it is? I know this is a very personal question and only I can make the decision. I was just wondering of there are others who went to the same thing. I am considering stopping due to all the possible side effects and possible problems that come with it by being on this meds essentially for the rest of my life and that honestly scares the living shit out of me. \n",

      "Using AI to generate captions/subtitles. Hi all! While I'm aware of AI being a potentially controversial issue, I believe that in this case it's super useful for deaf people like me. This recently released program generates subtitles for your video and even has the ability to translate them between languages. I put it to the test and evaluated it against Windows 11 live captioning, Google's live captioning, and YouTube's live captioning. I tested it using artist videos for an anatomy course that had a lot of technical language that live captioning couldn't decipher. Haha, but there is no issue with the AI subtitle generator. So that's why I'm impressed.Perhaps it's of interest to somebody here.[Whisper GUI - Generate Subtitle for audios and videos. by GRisk (itch.io)]( P.S. I hope I'm not breaking any rules here.

      "How helpful are Background and Window customization options for Closed Captioning? Hello all! I'm a hearing person and have recently began working in video accessibility. I've been wondering what opinions you may have on the background and window features of Closed Captioning.Main Questions:- Is one feature preferred over the other?- Is it common to use both?- How useful is it to be able to choose separate colors for them when both are in use?- Any pet peeves about the visual display and customization of CC?From my own experience and testing, I've noticed the following possibly negative aspects of each feature, but I'd love to know whether they actually matter to you or not.Background:- On certain platforms, the height of the background color is too small for the height of text. This causes some letters such as lowercase 'p' or 'g' to extend past the background color on screen.- Some platforms have a different background color width for each line of text, so there may be a long line directly above a very short line. It looks like live news captions (which are terrible for just about every reason under the sun), so that might be triggering, but it does block less of the screen that way. Do you care if the background is fitted to the text, or is it important to have a consistent width for the background color?Window:- Some platforms have space vertically between lines of text, and the window covers that space so that more of the screen is blocked. However, the impact of this can be lessened by making the window partially transparent if need be.Lastly, please let me know if this question would be worth crossposting in r/LowVision or if there is a broader r/ that I should be addressing instead. This is my first Reddit post and I don't know much about the culture so feedback on that would be much appreciated!Thanks! \n",

      "Creativity in alt text for images I work in accessibility for a large university. We are always keen to update our resources and training for content creators on campus. One area everyone seems to struggle with is creating alt text. It is often too long, or too short, and very boring and non-descriptive.After taking Shannon Finnegan and Bojana Coklyat's workshop *Alt Text as Poetry,* one idea I am floating is the use of haiku as a model for alt text. The reasoning is:* haiku by definition is only ever 17 syllables and therefore* if you use average-length words you often come in with between 60 and 100 words* using haiku will add more thought and depth to the descriptive process = more accuracy* sometimes the exercise will reveal that the picture is purely descriptive and therefore superfluous for ALL users* haiku is fun both to create and consume and therefore will encourage both creators and users to engage with the contentHowever, I am not browsing the web with a visual disability and I have no idea if this is something a person employing a screen reader would find useful and engaging, or annoying and gimmicky. Having watched demos of people using screen readers at phenomenal speeds I get the impression the worst thing is superfluous content and do not wish to add to this, but I also want my community of content creators (over a thousand people) to engage with (and write more thoughtful) alt text. What are your thoughts? I am happy to have this idea shot down in flames but would really welcome the community's idea. \n",

      "Deafness and wisdom teeth I (22M) recently discovered that I have a hearing loss concerning only my left ear. Many audiometry tests shown that I’ve lost about 60% of my hearing abilities on my left. But we don’t know the cause of my deafness. I know that I have to put effort to have time to do medical analysis, but my studies and student work reduce strongly my free time.My parents had recently met a couple of old physiotherapists that told them that my deafness is “necessarily” linked to my wisdom teeth. “A young man that loose his hearing suddenly ? It’s impossible”. I never met these physiotherapists : they didn’t see my dentition, they only suggest this hypothesis. But this strongly convince my parents to want me to extract my wisdom teeth.So here are my questions :Have you, or do you know someone whom ever experience a loss of hearing due to his/her (wisdom) teeth ? What should I do ? In addition :- I don’t have time, neither the courage to extract my teeth, or do any surgery if this hypothesis is false. - I think that asking a dentist would necessarily lead to validate this hypothesis, since it is a way to make money \n",

I'm good friends with the creator of ASLDeafined.com, and now he is launching a second website with one-on-one help called Sign-OnC.P.R.!Small Backstory: The creators of Sign-On noticed that the Deaf community in Michigan can be really spread out, so it's difficult for people learning American Sign Language to meet deaf people and practice. Particularly, interpreters have a hard time getting hours they need to complete the program because events are far and uncommon. They decided to make a website and bring the Deaf community to the comfort of your own home!Learners: You will sign on to the website at an appointed time YOU choose and meet with one of our Deaf ASL Experts for 30-minute sessions. No matter what time or day you log on, there will always be a real Deaf person looking at you on your screen! They will help you review whatever you like, teach new signs, or just chat in ASL! YOU decide what we study!Another important piece of information is... **we're hiring**! All Deaf ASL Experts must be Deaf or deaf and be fluent in American Signed Language. This is paid, and the hours are flexible and as frequent as you like! If you are interested, or would like more information, please PM me and I can answer any questions you have!Feel free to comment below with questions/comments.Link:  note that the link above only serves for information. Some features on the site are still in development, but it has a lot of information about the site itself and how it works.* :) \n",

I have a question. Hearing people and those who are more in tune with their speaking skills: How do you not run out of breath so easily, and talk quickly? I don't think you're exactly supposed to suspend your breath while talking, but I dunno. Anyway, how would I go around this? Apparently my speech pattern is like Stevie from Malcolm in the Middle, although obviously less extreme--thanks Mom (in fairness, I asked)!And how does one talk quicker? I am sure it's like sign language in that you are faster and better the more you practice... but I don't even interact that much with my family anyway (not that they can't use SEE) and I am too ashamed to practice in public.

I subscribed to this community because I am so interested in immersing myself further into the Deaf community after taking a year of ASL classes (ASL I + ASL II).  Learning the language has been relatively easy for me and I really could see myself becoming an interpreter possibly. So now to my real question - I work at Wegman's and yesterday I saw a husband and wife who were deaf - I saw them signing and got so excited to talk to them that I ran up and asked if they were signing/if they were deaf and they responded yes and suddenly my mind blanked on a lot of signs I know.  I was really annoyed with myself because I knew half of the things I was saying (regrettably I was talking along with signing because I became nervous) but I just forgot due to nerves.  So, I just want to know if anyone has any tips so I don't look like a moron next time?  The husband and wife seemed very elated that I was able to sign with them and the husband even turned back around and started a conversation with me about Dancing with the Stars - so he seemed intrigued that I could sign and I told them to always ask me for help if they need it and see me!Any pointers?? \n",

      "Boyfriend wants me to interpret For some context, I am hearing in a deaf hearing relationship. Lately I have noticed that when my boyfriend and I are at events, he wants me to interpret in conversations. To be clear, I don’t mind at all (although it can be frustrating sometimes, as me being the interpreter means I can’t really join in on the conversation). What confuses me is why he would want me to interpret: I’m still learning ASL and I have absolutely no education on how to interpret correctly (I feel I am quite awful at it actually). One example is the most baffling to me: we were at an event where there were actual interpreters there who’s job was to facilitate conversations more easily. I told my boyfriend to invite one of them over, but he says he “prefers me to do it”. When I asked him about it later, he says that he just likes it better. I just can’t understand why this would be the case. Like he probably knows that it’s hard for me to be a part of the conversation if I’m interpreting for him, and it’s hard in general for me because I’m still not fluent in ASL. Again, I really don’t mind if it’s needed, but in a situation like this, wouldn’t it be better for everyone if he used a professional interpreter rather than me? I’m afraid to press the issue, as I don’t want to be an audist denying him access (again, I really don’t mind interpreting at all, I just can’t understand why he’d want me to do it especially when there’s a better option available). \n",

I ended up calling the company, who said they stop supporting the model, and ran out of parts for it.

I've been trying to educate myself on Deaf culture, which she identifies with, and I've been wanting to learn ASL to be able to communicate better with her. I don't think I would lose interest in learning ASL because I'm interested in getting to know this woman even as friends. My plan was to begin this summer after work settles down.However, when talking to a friend about it, she said that this was a \"non-genuine reason\" for learning ASL. She told me that the Deaf community would find this offensive since the reason motivating wanting to learn the language and about the culture is to better get to know an individual. I don't want to offend anyone, but at the same time, I can't pretend that my initial reason for wanting to learn ASL is not because of an individual. Maybe over time, I will begin to want to learn ASL and Deaf culture for my own benefit; but for now since I'm interested in this woman, I'm interested in learning these things because of her.Anyway, my question is will people be offended that I want to learn ASL for this \"selfish reason\" (as my friend was calling it)?

I was just wondering if there was a better way I could have gotten his attention and let him know I wished to sign with him I wasn't just touching his hand; a more suitable way within the community.(He did remember me so it wasn't awkward apart from me hesitating to touch his hand the first time...)Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask but I'd appreciate any help, the deaf community in my town is quite small so I assume I'll run into him again and would like to know \n",

      "Creating an Assistive Device for Biomed Class Project Hello to the community! I am a student in a biomedical class at a university. In this class we have to prototype a biomedical device. I was interested in how deaf people interpret music. From research online and finding articles similar to this one  , the deaf use bass to feel the rythm of hearing music. I have also heard that you can also tell the pitch of notes based on how it vibrates in your body, like Beethoven. Do all the deaf possess the ability to distinguish notes like that?I would like to create a low-cost wearable device that translates frequencies to vibrations in the wrist to offer the deaf a different way to interpret sound. I wanted to know if this is something a deaf person who listens to hearing music would want? Let me know what you think, I am really curious! \n",

She has some vision but it's very poor.I'm in the process of transferring some home movies from VHS to DVD for her, and because the quality of the VHS is so bad, I'd like to try to enrich the video for her so she can have a better idea of what's going on in the video.I've thought about adding a subtitle track that gives a better description of the scene, but my worry is that I would have to make the caption so large that it fills the whole screen. But the benefit of having the subtitle track is that she could turn it off and on, so she could watch the scene for herself and then turn on the track if she felt like she needed more context.Anyway, I can't decide if this is a good approach or a terrible idea, so I'm turning to your community for suggestions. I would just ask her what she'd prefer, but we'd like this to be a surprise Christmas gift. \n",

      "My son, 8, will begin cane training next week...I want to throw up... My son is 8 years old and in 3rd grade. Vision 20/400. Ocular albinism.  His teachers met with me today to discuss their decision to teach him to use a cane. I love this child more than anything in this world and I absolutely want the best for him but when they told me that,  I felt like I wanted to throw up, I know it's selfish and horrid but I'm just being honest.  There is such a stigma around being blind. People are so ignorant, but I don't have the energy to educate them all. I feel like taking him around with a cane is just going to invite the masses to stare and gawk and comment.  Right now he gets around pretty well with me and even on his own in a familiar place, so his blindness is like our little secret.  It rarely even comes up. But now i don't feel like we 'll have a choice.  Please understand I would never let my son know how I feel about all of this and I will encourage him to use a cane and any other tools out there to help him be independent and mobile.   I'm just anxious about the stigma around it and and the unwanted attention.  Maybe I'm still trying to accept the fucking unfair reality of this stupid genetic mutation and it's impact on my incredible, perfect little boy.  I guess I could just use some encouragement... \n",

I'm not affiliated with them in any way or anything like that, I just thought that it would be something that your community may be able to use advantageously. While talking to a representative, I learned that you can purchase a text only plan for [super crazy cheap]( Unlimited text for $9+tax. If you don't use data (as in 3G/LTE/4G - WiFi connections don't count towards data use) a lot or at all, this may be perfect for you. They also apparently don't have any overage charges on data, so you don't have to worry about that. They use the T-Mobile network, so they have decent coverage in a lot of the US, as well. If you have any concerns or issues, they have a live chat on their website and they were very fast and concise when I spoke to them - though you DO have to go to the Help Center instead to get to the live chat, which was weird. You can also bring your own phone as long as it is GSM/Unlocked. US Mobile will also unlock your phone for $15 to be able to use their service!I don't know if anyone feels like this will help them or not, but I figured I'd mention it here just in case.

      "Accessible Groovebox - Novation Circuit Hey folks! wanted to share this in case anyone here is interested in making electronic music on the go / away from the computer. I recently acquired a Novation Circuit and it's _fantastic_ for low vision users! Many synths and grooveboxes smash a lot of buttons into a tiny box, and as a result the groovebox is nearly unusable for me. Tiny screens, tiny labels, and tiny fiddly bits are common on these machines, and short of memorizing the instrument it's difficult to use.Not only does the Circuit have no screen, all information is conveyed via high contrast, easy to see LEDs. the main working area consists of an 8 by 4 grid of velocity sensitive pads whose function changes depending on where you are in the instrument's workflow. This status is communicated by changing the color of the LEDs under the velocity pads. In many ways, the easiest and clearest way to see this instrument while working on a song is to dim all the lights in the room; it makes the colored lights much easier to see. I'm sure those of us with less/no residual vision can also make the device accessible with tactile bumps or braille, too.Anyway, wanted to share this find with everyone. I've really enjoyed noodling on a box that doesn't require me to squint to do basic things! \n",

      "I don't want to hear about your grandma Is anyone else tired of having hearing people go straight to \"Oh, you're HoH/Deaf? That's just like my grandpa/aunt/dad/someone in my life over 50!\" and then telling you at length about the medical history of all their elderly family members?I was at a party recently where almost everyone in attendance knew I was HoH, but didn't know me personally (work party). All of them commented on my hearing aids and how their various elderly family members were coping with their diagnoses. Then the person would walk away because we'd discussed my disability, they'd shared their one piece of disability knowledge, and they had ~normal~ people to talk to now.As someone who is queer, it feels very similar to when someone says \"Oh, you're queer? My son/niece/best friend is queer, do you know them?\" I'm white, but I'm sure it's also similar for BIPOC folks who get asked if they know every white person's one Black/Asian/Latine/Indigenous friend. Same with neurodivergent people being told \"I knew a kid that was autistic/had ADHD/bipolar in school!\"It's annoying. It feels very tokenizing and very much like they don't see us as people, just collectable characters. It also pushes home the idea that they really don't care about our lives, dreams, or personalities, they just see our hearing aids (or other assistive technology, or race, or religious clothing, or whatever is \"unique\") and assume that's the only thing we can talk about. \n",

      "Any deaf Houstonians? I'm running a neat study on a new non-invasive sensory technology for audition at Baylor College of Medicine. Seeking deaf research participants! We are a neuroscience research laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine, and we’ve developed a new kind of hearing tech. It’s a wearable vest with small vibratory buzzers in it (like the ones in your cell phone). Sound from the world is converted into patterns of vibration on the torso. At first the patterns have little meaning to the brain, but after some time the brain learns how to interpret them — essentially how to ‘hear’ through the torso. You can learn more about the technology in the link below. We’re looking for deaf individuals to participate in our training. This involves coming to Baylor College of Medicine 5 days/week, up to 3 hours/day, for up to 6 weeks. Our ideal participants are completely deaf (bilateral) adults (18+) who do not currently use any hearing technology (even better if they never have). You will be paid for your time. We’d be pleased to provide more information about the study, the technology, and the compensation. Please let us know what questions we can answer for you: novich@bcm.edu or eagleman@bcm.edu - David Eagleman & Scott Novich \n",

      "The older I get, the more I realize Hearing people are the ones disabled and not the Deaf people. Lately, I have been starting to notice behavioral patterns in the Hearing community that started to make me wonder about the real meaning of \"Disability\". So, I looked it up! &#x200B;>\" dis·a·bil·i·ty\\[ˌdisəˈbilədē\\]NOUN   >  >a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities.\"I have the benefit of being able to look at it from the Deaf side of things and I have noticed that Hearing people are so busy creating technologies that revolves around sound. Let me ask two questions for those who can hear: 1. **How many sounds do you hear right now in the room you're in?** Most people would say 3-5 sounds. 2. **How many things do you see right now in the room you're in?** Most people would say 20+ things. So this begs the question, why are Deaf people \"disabled\" and Hearing people are not? Just because Deaf people's body does not have a functional sense that Hearing people expects us to have, doesn't mean we're disabled. How can we be disabled over something we never had or even need? The true disability is when we DO have something and decide not to use it such as having the ability to see but takes it for granted via not using it to it's fullest capacity, thus harming themselves in the process. Here is why I think Hearing people are disabled: 1. They have a tendency to have an overreliance on audio technology at the expense of visual technology. (Example: Amazon's Alexa)2. Hearing people frequently dies from car accidents or work accidents because they're too busy hearing things such as phone calls or music. If they didn't have the ability to hear, they might still be alive today. 3. They have a tendency to trap themselves within a set way of thinking that impacts their abilities to see and interact with the world. (Example: Freaks out when sounds aren't working at the movie theater)4. They have a tendency to try and solve visual things with sounds. (Example: A Deaf person going to an eye doctor only to have the eye doctor start talking to the Deaf person, instructing the Deaf person on what to do while measuring the Deaf person's eyesight, all the while forgetting that it's A. a visual place for visual medical solutions, B. That the Deaf person is 100% visual, and C. That the Doctor should have been visually aware that their medical equipment is preventing the Deaf person from accessing their interpreter because the Doctor thinks talking with their voice box is an omnipotent solution aka. the only way to communicate as a human being.)5. Which leads to Hearing people's tendencies to stay inside a box and reinforce the linear aspects of sounds, imposing unrealistic expectations in order to maintain their audio-status quo. Meanwhile, Deaf people are outside the box, solving things, creating new visual technologies, being generally flexible and adaptable due to having to survive Hearing people's limitations as that is where the majority of the resources we need are at. I could list many more including that Hearing people are the ones creating war, famine, political dramas, many preventable accidents (which they tend to first blame Deaf people such as forklift accidents), and many more. But the whole thing led me to realizing that the more Deaf people tries to conform ourselves into the Hearing people's boxes, the more likely we will shape ourselves into the \"disability\" that the Hearing people think we are. By doing that, we're helping Hearing people to justify all their centuries of discrimination and harm against Deaf people, that we are indeed disabled and Hearing people are not. The only solution is to be ourselves, to be our full Deaf identity, and to go around in the community talking to all Hearing people with full ASL. I've done it and I've gotten some really surprisingly positive reactions. Now Hearing people are waving more at me and my wife, smiling and making attempts to talk in ASL instead of using their voices. &#x200B;For 2023, stop conforming to Hearing people's expectations and definitions. Be Deaf. Be you! \n",

      "Did I screw up my Audiology appointment? I went to my audiology appointment at last today, and apparently my hearing is in the normal range. I am feeling really let down for a lot of reasons (see my profile for a post in another sub detailing it all). But I had one question: I found myself holding my breath during the pure tone test, because the sound of my breathing seemed to overtake quieter sounds. Once I realized that breathing made it so I couldn’t hear as well, I held my breath so I could try to hear those quieter beeps. Some I honestly guessed on because I couldn’t tell if I was hearing my tinnitus or expecting the sound because they were at regular intervals. Anyway, does holding my breath and concentrating really hard on hearing sounds matter towards the results? It’s all basically mechanical isn’t it? So if I could “hear it” regardless of how silent it was or not, the mechanism is there.. right? It feels a bit BS to me because I definitely *do* have very difficult times in background noise of any kind. As a side note: My Audiologist said good luck getting any APD testing because nobody around here tests adults for it, so basically everything hearing-related I’m experiencing is apparently non-existent or unimportant diagnostically, despite my actual experience…???Thanks for any input! \n",

I just need the answers to the questions recorded as proof for my teacher.  The questions are;1) First name, age, city?2) Where did you grow up?3) What type of school did you attend? (mainstream, institute, oral school, etc)4) Describe your family dynamic.5) In your opinion, how can hearing and Deaf culture integrate more?6) How often do you work with interpreters, and what advice can you give to future interpreters?If you would prefer not to answer specific questions, thats absolutely fine, I understand! Id love to speak to as many as possible! PM me if youd like to be interviewed. Thank you again! And heres a link to my school ASL program so you have some proof as well;  \n",

      "Accessible plugins for audacity Hello!So, I've been getting into audio engineering more seriously lately. I've really enjoyed it so far, especially with the freedom that windows programs offer when compared to apple and suchlike.However, I consistently run into an issue.Many useful plugins such as crushers and even the built in mixer have very little to no accessibility. Currently, my operating system is windows 7, and my preferred reader is NVDA. Would there be a resource where I can find useful, accessible audacity plugins? Additionally, to those among you who use the program, what additions do you think are good to have?Thank you. :) \n",

      "VI folks who use a cane, how did you get over the feeling you weren't \"blind enough\" to use it? I've been carrying my cane around for the past few weeks, pulling it out for stairs and dark, places. It's an incredible confidence booster and comfort to have that option available, and when I do use it in those spaces I do a lot less guessing and a lot more knowing what's coming up in my path. It's also nice to have something to indicate I can't see like sighted people. (The White Cane Treatment you get from hospitality services is also lovely, mind you!)But I'm still struggling with feeling like I'm not quite blind enough to use this cane? I know that's silly, logically speaking. And I have friends who say I walk more confidently with it. But I can't shake the feeling that I don't deserve this treatment. I have 20/60 to 20/80 vision, depending on the day, and can manage most things pretty well without accommodations.But having people actually _help_ me navigate instead of struggling? Not feeling like everyone thinks I can't read? That I can have sighted friends point out things that may trip me? I feel this deep down shame that this help is not something I should have because I _can_ do it alone, even if that's a lot harder.I guess this a long way of saying \"I'm working real hard to overcome 30 years of mainstreaming and ableism and still struggle.\" Has anyone else in here gone through something like this? What helped you get through to the other side of this feeling? \n",

      "Should I continue to see a man who is attracted to my deafness? Something unexpected happened last week: I (MTF, 35) was having wine with my sister (F, 40) at a bar, and obviously we were signing. A slender white man (M, 31) approached us and told us that we are beautiful — in sign language. A flurry of questions came rushing through me: did he mean what he say or was he referring to my sister only? Is he really deaf, too? Why is there a white deaf man here in Malaysia? Who is he?The shy person that I am, I just froze at the presence of an unknown — and rather handsome — man. My sister instead was about to ask him something in sign language, but he immediately stopped her. He typed out in his phone that he is not deaf, and he knows only very few words. My sister proceeded to speak with her while interpreting what she and the guy said to get me up to speed. From what he told my sister, he’s an expatriate from the U.K. and he *loves* deaf culture. Long story short, this led to him asking me out. I disclosed to him that I am a transgender, and he said that didn’t bother him.We hardly texted the next day, only to set up a meeting for drinks that night. I took a Grab to a bar, and nervously waited for him. If this was a date, it would be the first time in 15 years since I had gone on one — and the maiden one since I transitioned. I almost had a panic attack when I saw him walk into the bar.During our conversation (we basically typed our conversation on our respective phones), he said he has a thing for deaf people. He said he finds deaf people sexy, whether we are completely silent or when we let out grunts and groans. And he is “mesmerised” when he sees people signing.It feels like he isn’t attracted to me as a person, but rather my disability. As if my deafness is a kink. I felt rather odd about his admission, and I just responded with an “OK”. But we continued talking through the night, and I even agreed to follow him back home. This man, who is rather good looking, wanted to have sex with me. While I felt odd about his deaf kink, I haven’t had sex in over 10 years — since I transitioned. This curiosity of having sex in my new body overpowered my relative disgust with this man’s objectifying me. And we did end up having sex. It was satisfying. And I stayed at his place for the night.But the day after that, I started wondering if it was wrong to be sleeping with him, who only wanted me for my deafness? And lo and behold, I discovered online that there is such a thing as a fetishism for deaf people. Apparently, these people find us deafies to be submissive due to out quiet nature.He has texted me since our meeting, but I have not committed to seeing him again.Should I continue to see him again? One issue that I have about forgetting this guys is that I live in Malaysia, a conservative Muslim-dominated country that casts aside transgenders. I am lucky to be born in a wealthy family, and the area I live in is pretty much liberal and westernised. So, while I can live freely (within the confines of this town), I have never met another deaf man, let alone one who has a preference for transgender women. And I do find him attractive. But his fetishism definitely weirds me out. \n",

      "How much do you use ASL idioms in (casual) text conversation? So observation in my Facebook, Twitter, and occasionally Tumblr with my d/Deaf/HOH friends and acquaintances has made me curious about the use of ASL idioms in online conversations, or in text messaging.  I see \"kissfist\" being used a lot, and there's some \"true biz\" as well.  I've even seen \"grab eyes\" used once or twice.Also instead of using the <3 that some hearing people use a lot, I've noticed _\\m/ (ILY handshape) instead.So I'm just wondering how often any of you guys might use ASL idioms or other aspects of the language when you're casually talking to someone through text.  If you do this, what idioms/symbols are you most likely to use?  How would you respond to this kind of thing becoming common among ASL learners or people who aren't fluent, the way that injecting spanish seems to be (with the use of casual phrases like \"Hola!\" and things)? \n",

Does it fulfil any actual need? Is there something missing? Is (part of) it useless?We have barely started working on this, so we still have the freedom to veer toward a completely different design.The current design is a box that sits atop a walking cane (although it could be handheld), it features a sonar or a laser that looks ahead and warns the user of any object in the way (vibrating with various intensities depending on the distance), and features a GPS which can be used to direct the user through precomputed routes (the routes would have to be preloaded, most likely from a computer, potentially a smartphone) and a bluetooth interface and/or speaker that speaks out these directions.This is the project in question:  you for your help! \n",

      "Curious: As a blind person, do you feel you are less susceptible to internet addiction? Earlier tonight, I posted on /r/depression about how sometimes I just sit here and stare at my computer screen and don't do anything at all. I received an overwhelming number of responses, and to me it is indicative of a large spread computer or internet addiction problem. (Link here if you are interested: [reddit!]( )So it got me to thinking, if you have to use a screen reader, it probably makes internet browsing more tedious and less immediately accessible because you have to wait to listen to each prompt instead of being able to visually skim over them. Do you think that helps blind people stave off addiction to the internet and digital devices in general? If so, do you think it gives you an advantage over sighted people?And finally one last curious question for fun, if I type :), how is it perceived by you? Does your software say \"colon parentheses symbol\" or does it say \"smiley face\"?     :) Peace \n",

      "Screen-Reader accessible gaming news roundup I figured I'd put a bunch of recent news on this subject into one post, because I suspect most of you aren't screen-reader users, and of those of you who are, I have no idea how many of you are into computer games.  So, here we go!First off, the IOS role-playing game Silversword got a massive update, and one of the features is improved accessibility when using the voiceover screen-reader.  From the update text:> added location info if VoiceOver is enabled, you can show it by using the \"magic tap\" (double tap with two fingers on the screen)For those of you unfamiliar with Silversword, it's a massive single-player RPG set in a large fantasy world, vaguely in the style of D&D.  It's billed as one of the largest RPGs on IOS, with somewhere around a hundred hours of playtime.  It was parcially accessible before the update, but now accessibility is pretty much complete.  You can get it via the app store at:  on the Windows platform, Valiant Galaxy Associates has released the much talked-about game Interceptor this week.  They've been working on it for slightly over a year, and now it's available for purchase (for $9.99).  From the game's description:> Interceptor is a new game from Valiant Galaxy Associates that puts the player in command of a space fighter in a do or die mission to save its mother ship.  As waves of alien fighters attack, the player must battle them, level by level.  On certain levels the player will gain other targets such as alien supply vessels, alien command and control vessels, and possibly even their own mother ship. You can buy Interceptor via GuideDog Games, at:  I'd like to plug another Windows game that's been eating my life for the last 3 days or so, called The Wastes.  Developed by fellow redditer /u/Huw2k8 it isn't intended as an accessible game, but because it outputs all text to a console window, it works fine with screen-readers anyway.  From the game description:> The Wastes is an infinite randomly generated wasteland game chock full of monsters, towns and encounters.Chock full might be an understatement.  I have never had two plays that were even slightly similar.  The game is in extremely active development, and gets near daily updates.  So head over to /r/Thewastes to find the latest version (0.7 as of this writing), as well as post suggestions and discussion.  And...I think that covers everything new this week.

      "Automatic Caption Syncing Hi, hearing person w/ auditory processing issues here. I was wondering if there was a program out there (either a public one or one a captioning agency uses) that automatically **synchronizes** captions. Not automatically creating captions, which are often borderline awful like YT's but one that automatically synchronizes a transcript that a real person transcribes onto the video/media. I've tried to have a hand in making captions for videos on Amara, and while I can type out transcripts easily, the syncing of the text is just too mind-numbing and tedious to bear (especially since I'm picky about timing them as exactly as possible). I feel like a manual transcript + automatic syncing would boost productivity by a LOT, and result in actual coherent and useful captions.I know SubSync exists, but as far as I know, it's just to synchronize subtitles that are a bit off.

      "I've made a rogue-like game for the visually impaired. Can you give me any feedback? Hey /r/blind!I’m a software developer who, as his thesis, created a rogue-like game for visually impaired. The interesting part of the game is that it gives you the possibility of describing everything that it’s going on and that is generated automatically based on some given grammars and dictionaries which, in the end, it means that the phrases that describe what’s going on are not very repetitive and making the game work the same way in a different language is pretty easy. Currently it’s available in English, Spanish, Galician and probably Dutch in the near future.I would like to hear your opinions so I could use them as documentation in order to show to my professors. Bear in mind that the game itself is just a prototype and very, very basic, so you are not going to get more than a few minutes of entertainment before it becomes repetitive (it doesn’t have lots of weapons, monsters or things to do). It’s just something very basic that I did completely from scratch to showcase how this automatic sentence generation could work for this or any other project.Also, even though the sentences are randomly and automatically generated, they are still kind of repetitive since I didn’t add thousands of different words or grammars, but that is a possibility that could happen in the future.The application is in Java, so you would need to have Java Access Bridge activated in order for the screen reader to actually read the output, as well as Java installed to run it. More information about Java Access Bridge:  game is in English by default, but you can change the language.properties file to =ES for Spanish or =GL for Galician.You can download the executable in a compressed file here:  controls are rebindable, but you can see the ones by default here:  project is open source, of course!Any kind of feedback or comment is appreciated and if you have any questions, let me know :)Thank you so much! \n",

I know how to record the real-time video calls between me and the other person, whether it be a VRS interpreter or another deaf person. Here's the dilemma: My area is serviced by Time-Warner, and I've been very deeply concerned about the potential Comcast acquisition of TWC - So this hit me on the occasion *IF* Comcast does succeed, it would be a good idea to keep track of every single interaction and transaction between me and Comcast to protect myself as a consumer. We all know this company's rep of screwing its customers over a thousand-times fold in comparison to TWC.In order to be able to collect phone recordings between me and a Comcast \"customer service\" rep, I would need to use my technical know-how in order to record the conversations via VRS calls. This is where it gets fuzzy, when it comes to my knowledge of the laws regarding surveillance. My question to experts in the VRS/VP/interpreter confidentiality laws... can I record the conversations after I get the VRS operator's permission to proceed? If yes, then would these hold up as evidence in courtroom disputes between me and Comcast?**I especially welcome thoughts and comments from interpreters who are working or have worked for the VRS industry.

I usually have enough to point my eyes towards the face of someone talking to me and can sometimes scrape together enough to use the mouse attached to the computer to find a control that does not play nice with carat navigation, but it is rarely usefule for most other things.Good glasses sometimes help improve things slightly but not usually enough to wear them very often so I rarely bother. After picking up my latest set of glasses today I have been wondering why I even bother spending the time, effort, and money on new glasses anymore.Maybe next year will the year I'll finally let those go as well. We'll see.Note: This is more me processing my thoughts than anything else.

      "I'd like some help figuring out if what I did was offensive or not (about fandom and Avengers) Feel free to ignore if it's not worth your time (I totally understand).So on tumblr there's a great love of Clint Barton (Hawkeye) canonically being HoH in some comics. Awesome, more representation :) So some people have been making \"headcanons\", here's one:Clint has given each Avenger a name in sign language.  Thor is the letter ‘T’ in the motion of a hammer.  Steve is a salute with an “R”. Hulk is an “H” over the bicep, but Bruce is the sign for doctor followed by the letter “B”.  Natasha is an “N” being shot from his other wrist like a widow bite. His own name is a “C” being drawn back like a bow.  Stark is an “S” taking flight, unless Barton is mad at him, then he fingerspells “A.S.” for Anthony Stark, but accidentally on purpose adds a second “S”. [here's the post]( thought it was cool but obviously didn't make much sense as a text, so I offered to make some gifs interpreting it. [here is the post]( am hearing, I did a bunch of research about namesigns and tried to be as respectful as possible, obviously it's a big deal in the Deaf community. But most of the reasons for a hearing person not giving themselves a namesign was because it's obnoxious, they don't understand the language and community (don't know if someone else has the sign), and it's just not done.I figured because I'm just re-enacting someone else's headcanon of a Deaf character giving fictional characters namesigns it'd be fuzzy on etiquette, but mostly okay because it's not real people.But I forgot how tumblr works. Recently it got quite popular, but for half the wrong reason. Lots of people are shouting at each other (for not think of Deaf culture as a real thing *headdesk*) but mostly at me by Hoh/Deaf/hearing people for cultural appropriation and audism and not being a real ally (honestly that last one struck me the most).Obviously tumblr's format and population isn't great for rational discussion. I'd like your opinion on what I should or shouldn't do. Mostly I don't want to get involved in a shitstorm, so I've stayed out of it. What's your opinion? Should I take it down and issue an apology? Is it another tumblr blow up about nothing really? \n",

      "Any retinopathy suffers getting Avastin shots? Looking for any and all experiences with the drug. My new eye doctor is wanting to start injections, but my insurance will only cover Avastin. I did some reading on the drug and I'm apprehensive about it. It was originally developed as a cancer treatment, but treating retinopathy/macular edema was an \"off label\" discovery (kind of like Viagra). Anyways, I read through the potential side effects with internal bleeding having the greatest potential along with slower healing. As a diabetic, both of those don't sound pleasant.What I'm wondering is, how much of those side effects would be present for someone getting a periodic shot versus someone getting the same drug through an IV?

      "Smartphones, the Internet and Facebook Hi /r/Blind, first time poster here. I'm asking questions on the above on behalf of my father.First, some background information: my father is blind, retired and 70 years old. He currently has an old-timey Nokia handphone with some sort of speech software installed, which I guess served him well enough because he routinely send text messages, etc. He also has JAWS installed on his PC, which he uses to Skype with people, email and occasionally browse the Internet.Now, here are my questions:&nbsp;**Smartphone**  I have a Samsung Galaxy Note. Yesterday, I bought a new one (Note 4) since the old one is getting on in years. When my dad learned of this, he very excitedly asked for my old phone, because he seem very impressed with its built-in voice navigation (also, it's fancier than his Nokia).I don't mind giving him my old phone, but I'm *very* concerned about his ability to navigate a touchscreen phone. For those with experience on this matter, are there any great impediments for the blind on using touchscreen phones? Are there any software I can install to make it better for my dad? &nbsp;**The Internet**My dad has JAWS installed on his machine, and can use the Internet. Unfortunately, he learns by rote, and I would like to enhance his experience by letting him learn the fundamental concepts of computers (e.g., files and folders, recycle bin, etc.). Are there any voice-only tutorials available that you guys would recommend? And while we're at it, are there any tutorials for JAWS that you can suggest, too? Right now, I think he's just \"winging it\". And finally,&nbsp;**Facebook**To make it short: is FB easily navigable for the blind? \n",

Just go to the front page, or /r/videos/ or /r/wtf or anyehere else that takes your fancy, and POST A REQUEST in our sub. You don't have to really want it. We ABSOLUTELY require requests to be made TODAY so the spark can catch and we can get people on board and make people see how useful this can be.    TODAY is when we get this spurt of visitors from all over reddit, but tomorrow the problem will be the same.

I just dropped my hearing aid into my drinking glass. I immediately grabbed it out, battery was already removed thankfully. I shook it a bit to get as much water off as possible. Then dropped it in a container of those silica crystals that come in packets of new things. After 5 minutes I blew it out with the blow dryer on COLD, making sure the temp didn't even get warm.

      "No Accessibility in New Internet Archive Layout Update: want to help? Contact info@archive.org and let them know that not only does accessibility matter, it's something they're obligated to provide.  So, tonight I went to download something from The Internet Archive ( and discovered that they have launched a new layout. I don't know how recent this is, as I only access the Internet Archive once every month or two. Unfortunately, the new site layout The Internet Archive has released has absolutely no screen-reader support what so ever. The problems include:1.  Incorrect use of headings. Many headings on a collection page are just random numbers, with no way to tell what they mean at all. Major sections on the page are not headings at all, either. Just these various unidentified numbers.2.  No alt-text. There are multiple images without any alt-text at all.  3.  Unlabeled links. Nearly all links on a collection page have no textual labels what so ever, so it is impossible to identify what they're for.4.  No ARIA landmarks, or any other way of identifying parts of a page.  See this page for a good example of the problems: half an hour of trying, I have no idea at all how to view or download any part of that collection.  And I can find no way to revert to the old layout, if that's even possible.  The accessibility of the site is so terrible that I'm even having trouble finding anyone to contact about this betrayal of the Internet Archive's mission of \"universal access to information\".  They're @internetarchive on Twitter, but that's really all I've found, and thus far, I have gotten no response from that account. I know that Jason Scott (@textfiles) works for them, and is active on Twitter, but I don't think he's actually responsible for any of the issues.  As The Internet Archive gets funding from the Boston Library Consortium, The Library of Congress, and Harvard, as well as many many other US organizations, I believe they are absolutely required to comply with the Americans With Disabilities act.  Unfortunately, I'm Canadian, so I can't pursue this.  So, Reddit, what's our next step? Can someone with some vision find an email address we can use for petitions? Can American readers sort out/go after the ADA violations?  This should have never happened, and as the Internet Archive is the closest thing The Internet has to a public library, we need to do everything in our power to make sure that fixing this issue becomes the Archive's top priority.Edit: after some more fiddling, I have a bit of it figured out.  You need to go down under the heading that reads \"language\".  Just above the random number headings, you'll find text like \"by Tape-A-Thon\".  Go up from there, and click on the totally unlabeled link that's just under the link that's labeled with the name of the collection.  Then you will get a semi-accessible page that will give you the opportunity to download that single file in multiple formats. [Example](  That page will have a totally inaccessible audio player, and a bunch of entirely unlabeled links. But it will have links labeled \"1 file\" and so on, just above the file format they will download.  As yet, I still have no idea how to download the entire collection, how to skip to the next page of results (I think it might be an infinite scroll?), etc.  I'll update if/when I find out anything knew, or hear from anyone at the IA.Second edit: you can revert to the old Internet Archive, \"for a limitted time\", by using this link: thanks to @adamdicarlo on Twitter.  There is also a pop-up that allows you to revert, that was discovered thanks to /u/geoffisblind, but it doesn't work at all with NVDA, only magnification.  Third edit: I've also heard back from @textfiles. Apparently, the address to contact is info@archive.org. I couldn't find that listed on an accessible part of the site, so thanks @textfiles.Fourth Edit: Thanks to @Simon818 on Twitter for discovering that The Internet Archive lists it's email address in plain text on the terms page. Because why wouldn't you think to try there?  But if you want to verify the address in this post, clicking the terms link is the way to do it. \n",

My paper discusses why people gauge the trustworthiness of others by what they see. For instance, in a library, people are very likely to ask someone sitting near them if he or she can watch their stuff for them while they go to the bathroom or something. This is paradoxical because they end up trusting individuals over the population they are a part of simply because they can see them and make judgments. The person they ask, as a member of the population of people in the library, is exactly one of the people they're scared might take their stuff.I am interested in the process of developing trust for people who do not have the ability to make judgments of the trustworthiness of others based on sight, so I would like to ask a few questions to such a person.

Walking with the cane made me feel more confident, seen, and safe than I have felt in a long, long while.

      "How do you feel about song/music interpretation at ASL-themed events? I went to an event that was not labeled a Deaf event, but rather an ASL event. Almost half of the event was hearing interpreters interpreting songs. And the parts of the event that were just in ASL were voice interpreted.I don't know how I feel about this and I am hearing. Am I making too big a deal about it? I was just...thrown off by it. If I go to an event that is supposed to be celebrating ASL, I expect it to focus on ASL, not be interpreted or have a bunch of music playing. And most of the performers were hearing people. However, having an interpreter and the music is more inclusive for ASL students whose level may not be at the point that they can understand everything on their own.I was hoping /r/deaf could give me some insight as to how the d/Deaf community feels about events like these.

This research aims to compare the experiences of deaf and hearing people in the city. As such, how the city is perceived as a space (is it somewhere you like to go, or do you feel it is dangerous as a result of being deaf, etc?) will be examined against the responses of hearing people.This research will be carried out via a questionnaire and online study. The questionnaire will ask you about your experiences and feelings of the city, whilst the online study aims to generate a model audiogram with which to compare your experiences against (For example, if you find the city dangerous as a result of not being able to cross the road easily, this will be compared against your model audiogram which will inform me as to whether you are able to hear the beeping of the pedestrian crossings, and therefore will assist me in determining the accessibility levels of the city.)All participants must be between 18 and 40.You do not have to be living in or near a city - your experiences of cities that you have been to in the past will be fine.Participants that are hearing, have a hearing-aid or cochlear implant are all eligible to take part. The information I require will be your email - send this to me by direct message through Reddit - do NOT post it on this thread. I will send you the link to the website to generate your model audiogram, as well as the questionnaire and consent form via an email attachment.The identities of all participants will be kept anonymous, and the research will not impact your access to medical care or schooling.

      "people who use frequency compression - how different is your world from before you got your hearing aids? I have a high frequency hearing loss where my hearing flatlines starting at ~500 Hz. I've had several pairs of hearing aids over the years, and none of them have helped me hear better. In the past, I told my audiologists that I couldn't hear high frequency sounds no matter how high the volume, but all of them just told me to just \"get used\" to the hearing aids. I never did... and it would be too late to return them by the time I figured that out!This week, I went to a new audiologist and she was the first to actually listen to my past experiences. She agreed that amplification in the higher frequencies wasn't going to help with my type of hearing loss, and suggested I get new hearing aids that support frequency compression. I was relieved to be taken seriously and excited to try out something that might actually help me hear better - but I'm also trying not to get my hopes up; I've underwent a lot of disappointment, heartbreak, and anguish when my hearing aids didn't meet my needs (my parents would yell at me when I was a kid - \"those earphones are $8000, how come you still can't hear?!\" etc). I know frequency compression can work for me as I've replicated (albeit crudely) the effect on some of my favorite songs using audio editing software. But it's hard for me to imagine what it'll be like, or whether or not it's actually possible to cram the bulk of the human auditory range into a small window maybe 250 Hz wide. Will I be able to pick out voices at bars? Will birdsong sound the same as how hearing people perceive it, or will it be some monotone drawl? Will girls still sound pretty? And so forth.I'd appreciate any perspective r/deaf has to offer - I will definitely look into getting new hearing aids, but I just want to get an idea of where this should fall on my list of priorities. \n",

It’s especially prevalent against landscapes with majestic expanses of sky and water, which are my favorite, and I have difficulty doing computer work. Are there special glasses that are tinted to help minimize floaters, or recommendations of screen settings? For now, I’m trying to budget my time and minimize strong light, but I want to live my life! Any recommendations for minimizing eye strain and floater-consciousness is much appreciated. \n",

      "I witnessed the strangest behavior with a blind person the other day, and I need help understanding what I saw. So a few friends and I were riding a rather crowded subway train downtown.  At one stop a man who was obviously visually impaired boarded with his adorable seeing-eye dog.  His body language seemed to indicate he was headed in a different direction, but instead in a split second moved to walk down our aisle, where his dog abruptly stopped in front of the backpack my friend had clumsily placed between his feet in a manner that was blocking the aisle a bit.\"Excuse me,\" he said.  \"Is there something blocking the path?\"  My friend then scrambled to move his bag to clear a path for the man, and apologized.  \"Thanks!\" he said, and then took his seat.The golden retriever who was wearing the most adorable little doggie shoes, crawled under the man's seat and took a nap underneath him, resting his head on the mans shoes.  The ride went on, and a few minutes later I was daydreaming and looking out the window, when my eyes scanned across the man again.He was reading his cell phone.I was very confused.  Maybe it was a special braille phone?  I examined him for a bit, and it appeared to be just a plain old iPhone.  He was flicking across the screen in the same manner that I would casually read Facebook posts.  The phone was a standard distance from his face, and his eyes were fixed with a very normal, unstrained expression that seemed to indicate his eyes were taking part in reading whatever was on the screen.  If you saw just this, you'd never know he was blind.My question to you:  How is this possible?  Is there a form of visual impairment that would prevent somebody from seeing the world at large, but still allow them to read something up close just fine?I wondered if he was just training his dog and was pretending to be blind to replicate an authentic scenario, but the dog appeared to be a veteran performer with no \"dog in training\" gear, and behaved extraordinarily efficiently.  I have no idea what to make of this. \n",

      "Teaching My Son to Solder Hello everyone,My son is blind and VERY into electronics and programming.  The programming stuff has been easy to teach since adapting the process just needed JAWS or similar (for Linux based work).  We started our work on electronics with the simple and safe Snap Circuits (which I cannot emphasize enough for teaching electronics to ANY person, child or adult).  Now that he is older, we will be moving into a more advanced level of electronics by creating circuits and soldering them onto circuit boards.I am wondering if anyone has any resources that can help me teach him to safely solder the components to the board.  Obviously, we will start with a cold iron and \"pantomime\" soldering the components, but where do I go from here?Just an FYI, he has some vision at the moment, but his condition will cause him to be totally blind at some point in the future.  As such, I would like to make sure that whatever I do, he can use now and when he no longer has any sight.Thanks for any help that you can give! \n",

That video would then be sent out to volunteers to record a voice over that would describe the scene in as much detail as possible, and sent back to you. When you get the message, you can play it back with the voice over playing over the original sounds you had recorded. It's like an enhanced recall app.If we worked out the trolls and got some really good story tellers as volunteers, would you guys be interested in something like that? \n",

      "VR Augmented Aid for the elderly with bad vision & low vision individuals. This originally started as a school project in 2007This was a process in which the VR display was adjusted so that people with low vision could see more easily. Mounted with a camera this was a very effective method. We had one test on a friend with low vision and it worked very well. As the technology grew more available this did become cheaper but we stopped once the project was over in 2007. A standard resolution 640x480 head display and color camera were used originally. Due to advances in retinal prosthesis and surgeries we deemed it a useless concept and it was bulky. Now it is 2015 and the with the use of android phones and Google cardboard it has made it possible for everyone to try this concept out.Near Sighted -VR Augmented Aid Test App:  you legally blind? Do you have low vision or can only see things up close ? Then this app might be for you. NearSight is an application that works with your phone and the OpenDive VR display or any DIY VR displays. It uses the camera on your phone and displays the front image to the phone screen in stereoscopic. We feel that with time we can develop more devices and/or applications which will help people with visual or eye disabilities. What you need for the App: An Android phone A head mount display compatible with a phone screen Adobe Air Start up the app and it's good to go. Tap the center of the screen to exit. No ads & Open source. To download the FLA file please visit the following link. This is also a great way to create augmented reality applications.Open Source Link:  Make your own VR display:3D print Open Dive:  I/O Cardboard:  Please note you have no peripheral vision while using this application.

There is a public domain resource for learning statistics:  Many of the formulas in the book are in png and jpg form.  What we would like to do is take a few of the formulas and try a few different MathML approaches so that blind users can review and give us some feedback on what works and what doesn't.  Once we have an idea of what is beneficial, we will work on rewriting some more of the formulas.Tools like MathJax and MathML are working to improve the usability of math, and I'm collaborating with some EPUB / MathML authors to find out what works best.  The biggest concern is that just because a formula appears correctly on screen - the MathML utilized may not be accurate for some reason.  Then, on top of the MathML, there are semantics properties defined at  .  Are these semantics useful to blind users, or are they just for machines?Please share if you know anyone that might be able to provide advice.

      "Should I just take the stairs? My school has over 2000 students and tiny ass stairwells, as well as a strict rules about not going to upper levels before the first bell rings after break and lunch, but we can’t be late either so as you can imagine the stairs become very packed in between classes. I have poor depth perception as well as crappy sight in general, after being at my school for about five years, I finally gathered the courage to ask for lift access and  surprisingly got it BUT I don’t get a lift key which means I have to wait for a member of staff to pass by the lift so they can use theirs.    I’m far too socially awkward for this, but with help from my friends have used the lifts a few times now. Today the encounter went like this.My friend and I stand by the lift, she acts as a look out because we need to find someone with a lanyard (it functions as a lift key). We find a teacher who came by the lift.Us: Miss could you tap the thing for the lift pleaseHer: \\*looks the both of us up and down\\* I don’t see anything wrong with you (she said it jokingly)(for context, only students with things like crutches get lift access) Me: Eyes.Yeah probably could have given a better explanation but I hate having to explain why because- you can imagine why since most people live under the perception that glasses fix everyone’s vision as long as they are not born blind.  She did tap her lanyard though.After one of my classes, I asked one of my teachers to tap their lanyard and she asked me “why?” so even the people who are well aware of my impairment don’t get it so now I just feel really awkward about it.   I asked my school if I could get a lift key but they said it’s most likely that I can’t. But it’s not certain because they’ve never had a cane user before. Though, when I get mine I know I’ll always use it outside but I don’t know about in doors in my school building soo. Also I‘m going to be getting a pass to leave lessons a few minutes early because if I walk to my lessons while everyone else is, I bump into people constantly, so I’ll be without my friends. And even so my friends can’t be with me all the time and I want to be independent but if I need a member of staff it’s really hard to spot one so I can never get the lift on my own. If I take the stairs I only feel kinda safe when I’m holding onto a friend which isn’t practical or realistic for the future. I can use the stairs on my own… ish. I’ve never fallen or even tripped, at least not in front of anyone but I’m really scared that I will, especially because I could hurt a lot of people. It’s really annoying because I had one in my old school but they weren’t as up tight.What do I do if they say no to getting a lift key? \n",

      "Need advice on tackling communication problem I am in a team with a HOH person.  This person is not exhibiting much ability to understand the viewpoints of others on the team.  Even when we work in email, this person doesn't have a lot of skills in \"hearing\" other viewpoints or \"listening\" to what others are saying.  This person is highly literate, so it is not a literacy issue, and as I said, we are doing much discussion in writing.  So this is not a hearing problem.The question I have for this reddit:  In having a conversation about the communication problems we are all having, as I imagine tackling the conversation, I am having a hard time thinking of ways to describe the problem that don't involve the metaphor of \"listening\" to what others are saying, having everyone be \"heard\" in a discussion.  In my preamble I tried to describe the problem using words/phrases like \"understand\", \"be understood\", \"give attention to\"... but it really didn't describe the issue well and is a limited vocabulary.   I don't want to insinuate that this is a literal hearing vs deaf issue: it has nothing to do with deafness - but as soon as I use words like \"Hear\" or \"listen\" it would become about deafness.  This is just a person who, like many a hearing person, does not \"listen\" well in the metaphorical sense. Can you help me find the right language to communicate this problem constructively to a person who even in writing (for lack of a better phrase again) does not \"hear\" what others have to say. All suggestions welcome.  I want to improve communications in this team, and I don't want my limited metaphors to become a red-herring.  Thanks in advance. \n",

      "My legally blind friend (early 20's high school grad w/ some college) can't find work. How can I help him? So yeah my friend is 23 and legally blind (retinitis pigmentosa). He graduated High School and attended college for about a year and a half, but dropped out because of finances. He tried finding work about a year ago (I don't know how extensive his search was), but he wasn't able to find anything. He gets kind of sensitive about it when I bring it up (understandably), but he really does need to find work because his financial situation is looking pretty bad. Are there groups that help find work for the blind? Is there anything I can do to help him find a job? Please let me know. Thanks! \n",

      "Any Supernatural fans wanna talk about Eileen Leahy (portrayed by Shoshannah Stern)? Realistically I can't be the only the fan of *Supernatural* here.  I started watching the show in 2014 when I went to university, and I was shocked to see Eileen appear in season 11. She's the first deaf character I ever saw on a show, since I never watched things like *Switched At Birth*. She was also super smart and badass. Her introduction episode (Into the Mystic) where she kills the banshee is amazing. Definitely one of my favorites. As the show went on, I became increasingly disappointed because they didn't give her enough screentime and none of the main characters ever talked about her like they did other minor characters. But somehow she and Sam are supposed to be in love even though the show never mentions if they are in contact with each other to develop a relationship? >!And then obviously they killed her off, and Sam and Dean immediately forgot about her. The only reason she was brought back was to serve the plot and bring Sam into Chuck's grasp. She's a sort of deus ex machina.!< I don't like how the writers handled her character. They did her dirty! Eileen was a powerful and unique character, but they reduced her to a plot device. They didn't even bring her back for the final episode--just a blurry woman standing in the distance that might be her or it might not be her. I was wondering if anyone else in the deaf community had any thoughts about her character or role in the story. Full disclosure: I'm mostly asking because I just finished writing an essay examining Eileen’s character, role, and arc in *Supernatural*, as well as hearing audience perceptions of these. I can finally relax a little and have fun chatting about her instead of analyzing. For the paper I focused on hearing people's perceptions of Eileen (since the fanbase is mostly hearing), and while most of them liked her, a lot of them were ignorant about her deafness. A couple of people said Eileen wasn't believable as a deaf character like, “How can Eileen speak if she’s deaf?” or “I found a plot hole—notice Eileen, who’s supposedly deaf, uses a \\[smart\\]phone in this episode!” Like bro. Come on. Other people said she wasn't believable as a hunter, which is a more realistic criticism, but I address it in my paper to prove why Eileen can be a deaf hunter. Not only does she have eyes, but she can pick and choose which monsters she hunts and also team up with hearing people if she wants. It's not that hard, right? Anyway--What do you think about Eileen? \n",

      "First two days with my hearing aid So, I posted probably a month and a half ago in here about getting a hearing aid. The day finally came yesterday. I have been deaf in one ear for the past 8-10 years. When the audiologist turned it on for the first time, I was just super overwhelmed. I could hear the little things for the first time in years...the sound of paper rustling, clothing brushing against skin, voices in the next room with the door closed, insects outside, birds in the trees. I listened to my favorite album, Above & Beyond's Group Therapy, which came out in 2011. It is an album I have heard hundreds of times. Hearing it yesterday was like the first time all over again.It is going to take time getting used to this. But my gf and I went out for drinks last night, and for the first time, I could hear her voice, without having to sit on her left side, in a crowded bar. To me. Just so many beautiful moments and I wanted to share with you guys! \n",

      "My friends are annoyed I’m embracing my deafness Kind of just a rant here. I always struggled with my hearing, even as a kid, but my parents were never really active in my health aside from doctor’s appointments for my eczema. My family knew I couldn’t hear and mom knew some sign and would use it with me growing up. Last year I got to a breaking point, went to see an audiologist, and was told I have moderate-severe loss. I got my first pair of hearing aids and cried the first time I put them on, I was so happy. Since then I’ve been trying to become more involved with the Deaf community. I tell people I’m deaf/hoh because I’m not sure which I identify with quite yet (I mostly feel nervous to identify as deaf since I’m so new to the community but I’ve seen so many posts about that topic that have been so helpful). I’ve been learning sign, going to events, pushing myself to meet new deaf/hoh people. And this somehow is not sitting well with some of my friends. They feel I did a complete 180 on them and that our relationships went from knowing I can’t hear well to suddenly my deafness becoming my “whole personality”. My family has been surprisingly very supportive, and I honestly thought these 2 groups would be flipped. Idk part of me feels like maybe I did jump in too hard? But the other part of me feels like I’m allowed to be proud of this part of myself and want to become involved in the community. Idk I have weird feelings about it but I should probably just stop hanging out with them lol. \n",

She lives alone on the opposite side of the country (she moved for work).

Until today, I’ve never really had access to interpreters for medical appointments, though I have used them for education and employment.I’m anticipating a series of 7-14 procedures in Rochester. Each one will involve by being put under anesthesia for a short period, and then a ~1-1.5 hr recovery period before I can leave. In the past, my pre- and post-op haven’t gone great. One surgery a few years ago, I had my best friend in the pre-op room repeating every question to me during the intake because the staff refused to face me so I could speech-read. When they wheeled me into the OR, they started talking to me behind their masks so I told them I couldn’t hear them and just started guessing at what they needed from me. Later, the surgeon came out to my friend and apologized as she didn’t realize I would struggle that badly.What should I consider? The procedures won’t interfere with my movement at all (except for an IV).

Apparently im like an elephant, and sometimes i talk quite loud So she wanted me to have a hearing test. I tried to get one but in the UK everywhere told me to see my Doctor. Who Shrugged me off at the time and papped me off to a nurse who wasnt interested. So i ignored it. I started a new job in an office and started finding it hard to hear people due to background noise (office situated under a boiler room) Had the sudden realization that i Lip Read people and then it all made sense. Ive always used ear protection while playing drums and even when i was a carpenter i always had defenders in.My body had gotten used to the fact that my hearing was deteriorating and i hadnt even noticed. So after arguing with my doctor i finally got my hearing test. i was -35db deaf in my right and -50db in my left.They then done several more tests over the few months but i ended up having a second test which showed my left ear t -55db and my right at -50db.The doctors are puzzled as to why. But im just happy i found out.Everything started making sense as to why i struggle hearing or im a million miles away when people talk to me.At least im getting hearing aids in a few weeks. and then we can go from there. Thanks for reading haha :)  \n",

      "NAD has just filed a lawsuit against Harvard & MIT for not properly captioning their free, public-facing online lectures. I have very mixed feelings about this. Am I alone? I just read [this article][1] reporting how the National Association for the Deaf is suing Harvard and MIT over failure to properly caption their online course videos.  [1]: deaf, wear hearing aids, and love Coursera because they have good captions on their courses.  As it's extremely difficult for me to understand speech without lip reading (25-30% recognition rate with my ears only), captioning/subtitling is a vital requirement for me to understand movies, TV shows and video lectures where lip reading is hit or miss.  Websites like OpenSubtitles are a life-saver for online TV downloads.That said, I have very mixed feelings about this lawsuit, for several reasons1. These videos are offered free of charge to the public2. Captioning is a pretty expensive and labor-intensive service.  3. Is it reasonable for smaller schools with similar online offerings to absorb the cost of captioning their videos?  What happens if its decided that the price is too high, and the services are revoked as a result?I imagine something similar came about regarding TV captioning services, but believe there is a crucial difference here.  Networks get paid for broadcasting their content, and the cost of captioning their broadcasts is significantly less than the advertising revenue that is brought in because of the inclusion of a deaf/hard of hearing audience.  With MOOCs/free online course videos, there is no such additional stream of revenue.  At most, someone may be inspired to enroll in a program as a result of these video lectures... but how realistic is that?  Some transcription products, such as Dragon, work pretty well in transcribing lectures, given the existence of a good voice profile.  Even so, the transcript will require some heavy editing for it to be caption-ready. While I encourage deaf advocacy groups in their quest to broaden the availability of accessible content from providers that receive  enough compensation to offset the cost of captioning/subtitling, I am much more wary of similar targeting of providers who don't receive such compensation and may be forced to shut down as a result.  I just don't see any benefits of the possibility of denying deaf and hearing people an entire source of educational content that is essentially an advertisement for the institution. \n",

      "Sign language apart from Deaf culture [x-post /r/ASL] I'm in a linguistics graduate program at a university that is big on both experimental and theoretical work, but doesn't have any Deaf Studies or ASL. I wrote my MA thesis on theoretical syntactic issues using data from ASL non-manuals, and I would like to continue working with sign language data, perhaps looking more closely at the timing and articulation of non-manuals in sign languages.I've taken 1 year of ASL, both college classes and private lessons. So, basically I know how much I don't know. I feel like a hypochondriac with access to WebMD. I have enough knowledge to be dangerous, but nowhere near enough to cure anything. However, I can read the literature and use corpus data or even sentence elicitation to study the structure of ASL, as I have done for other languages I don't speak.I have seen several recent discussions about how it is nearly impossible for a hearing person to use ASL without appropriating Deaf culture. People are saying things like ASL is more than a language: it is a way of life. It's not a \"fun weekend project\" and hearing people should not be teachers of ASL. Basically, I have heard that learning ASL is not the same as learning Spanish or Mandarin because being Deaf is not the same as being Mexican or Chinese. I get that. Deaf is not an ethnicity. But as a linguist, I feel like this is a step backwards for sign languages. Saying that the language ASL belongs only to the Deaf and that you can't have ASL without Deaf culture, seems to be putting ASL back into the \"communication system for those who can't speak English\" box, rather than a rule-governed language that can be learned and studied. This seems like a conflation of language and culture on par with the \"Eskimos have 50 words for snow\" myth and all the Sapir-Whorf linguistic relativity that has been repeatedly denounced in linguistics literature.I understand that people are protective of their language and culture and don't want it taken over or changed from the outside. And I get that I am an outsider. But I haven't really come across this with any other minority language or fieldwork/language documentation work I have done. For example, people are of course proud to speak their Native American language, and they are proud of their Native American culture, but they do not seem to be putting the same pressure on those who want to learn from them.So, question, is it appropriation for hearing, non-signing linguists to use ASL and other sign languages in their research?  \n",

      "Hearing steadily getting worse, learn ASL now? I'm 26, and as of this moment I can hear well enough to talk to familiar people so long as I'm paying attention and there isn't a ton of background noise. But if they're facing away from me, or there's background noise, or music, or a TV on, then I might as well not even be listening. This is in contrast to a couple years ago where I could hear most people fine so long as I knew I was being spoken to. And a few years before that where I just found myself wanting to turn the volume on the TV up.I'm pretty confident that in a couple years I'm going to need to be leaning in really close to people with my head turned to hear them, and after that I'll either be unable to hear conversation or I'll need hearing aides. I have a feeling that I'm going to end up totally deaf before I'm 35. My doctor pretty much says, \"oh well, it happens. When it gets to the point you need them we can get you fitted for hearing aides\". I tried one of the ones he had there, and it sound like listening to people talk through volume-blasted am radio.

      "How blind people play live chess against one another I'm interested in the intersection of chess and a variety of health issues.  If you play this game or a similar one I'm curious about your experience and would love to hear about it. This video shows blind chess players competing on National Braille Day in India:  most interesting part of the video to me is the divots in the boards. This functional adaptation allows the players to use their hands to feel where the pieces are located without knocking the pieces over. Obviously one cannot simply drill holes in normal tournament boards because they are thin; these boards are made out of a thicker material, and the pieces have pegs coming out of the bottom to hold them in place.The clocks present an interesting challenge because players cannot see how much time they have or when an opponent loses on time. I think it would make sense for the clock to start beeping when a player runs out of time. Further, I could see an argument for an electronic clock that announces how much time is remaining at certain points in a game (30 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 minute for instance). While the touch-move rule (if you touch a piece you must move it; if you touch one of your opponents’ pieces you must take it if possible) is the standard for tournament chess, these players are essentially viewing the board with their hands. As a result, hitting the clock is what ends one's turn, and it also makes enough noise to signify to the opponent that it is now his or her turn. I know some blind people have analog watches with textures so they can feel the watch hands to determine the time, and I wonder if there is a chess clock that could be used the same way. My concern would be players accidentally or intentionally moving a hand on the analog chess clock when feeling for their time.One extremely fascinating element that I never would have considered is how one analyzes the position when it is not his or her turn to make a move. When two players can see the board, they can both analyze during any moment. But early in the video, both people take turns feeling the board even though only one player’s clock is running. There is definitely an additional psychological element when the players are both blind, perhaps related to empathy or understanding. I imagine a blitz game between two blind opponents would present quite a few difficulties. That being said, if blind players primarily or completely analyzed in their minds similar to playing blindfold chess, this would significantly or completely reduce the time for feeling the board. Further, if there is one assistant that can see the board, this helper could make the moves the two players verbally state in a blindfold game.In this video, there are many individuals watching the games that are available for helping out. There are also flowers on each table which is a nice touch. The players are not recording their moves but this could be done in more serious tournaments. In my 10-plus years of playing chess, I never played any blind opponents. As a result, I assumed chess was relatively inaccessible to people that are blind. After watching this video, it is clear there are challenges blind people experience that I do not face when playing the game, but blind people can certainly play live chess, especially with this type of unique board. Further, I wonder if frequently feeling the piece relationships with one's hands offers insight that people that see the board with their eyes could benefit from at all. Most people see the board with their eyes but some experience it with their hands: these are just two different ways of playing the same game. \n",

      "VI Dad: Read a Book to my kids today for the first time - here’s how! Hey there! Been a lurker for a while. I have Cone Rod Dystrophy + nystagmus which has rendered me legally blind. Because of the nystagmus, my poor central vision is made worse due to my shaky vision. I rely mostly on audio things such as “Speak Content” on iPad and iPhone. Also, magnifiers aren’t that abundantly helpful (need to practice more_ because even magnified font is difficult to read while they shake. Because I am not able to read black text on paper (words on any sort of page is. Hard) as a dad, I feel I have been robbed of a “classic” dad Monet in my opinion. Snuggling up with the kids and flipping through and reading a kids book before bed. I compensate by telling stories and also kind of making stories up based on the images I can make out as I flip through the books they ask me to read. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to fix this problem for mystery and others. I came up with something! This isnt that revolutionary, maybe you’ve already done this but I wanted to share. I asked my wife to record a voice memo on her phone as she read through a brief childrens book and provide audio feedback such as: “next page”. So then she sent that filed over to me and I was able to play that audio on my iPhone with an AirPod in one of my ears. We need to practice more to get the cadence down, but basically I was able to listen to what she said in my ear, and then repeat that to my kids and follow along with her “next page” prompts. IT WAS AMAZING! Listen, I don’t know if there are copyright issuces with that, but that’s neither here nor there. I would love to build something for the VI community for parents that want to read their kids books! I hope this idea can help someone - but I also have been doing some research on doing this as a service to more folks. The problem I think would be publishers permission to have some reading their books and being recorded for others to listen to. the goal would be that the parent already owns the book and they are following along. Anyway, wanted to share - I hope that helps someone and would also love further ideas/feedback! \n",

So my question is: Would your experience be better with the sign language avatar instead of only text? \n",

      "Question about technology that “helps” deaf and hearing people communicate Hi all!Recently my mom and I got into a bit of a heated debate about those gloves that “translate” ASL into English. I was wondering if there is anyone who is familiar with the gloves that would be willing to give me their 2 cents on what they think about them. Do you think (if they worked) they would be helpful? Or do you see them as kind of a kick in the nuts to the deaf community?My mom and I are both hearing, but she’s been active in the deaf community and knows ASL, and I only know a little bit. I know where her and I stand, but I’m very interested to know what people who are actually apart of the deaf community feel.This is purely out of personal interest, not homework or actual research. [I’ve also read this post] ( but I’m looking more for what people think of the IDEA of the gloves, not so much the facts of the gloves. \n",

      "Driver's licence problems Personal background: I'm profoundly deaf, use ASL as my second language, and live in a first-world country that has third-world disability accommodation. I'm non-oral and communicate with hearing people mostly through writing. I don't use interpreters.Legal background: This country is a signatory to several agreements on the rights of the disabled, but this is largely strictly on paper. Disability-based discrimination is still legal, and happens frequently.I'm trying to get a driver's licence, and I find that people with disabilities are allowed to get driver's licences as long as they prove they're not a danger to the general public. In my case, the regulation is that I have to be able to hear car horns.The silver lining in the cloud is that this isn't a black-and-white regulation. If a doctor or similar personnel can declare that a particular substitute is appropriate, then you're basically good to go. I understand that some deaf people use light displays to alert them of car horns, which is not an option in my case.Any insight into how to get around this regulation would be most deeply appreciated. I'm clueless. \n",

      "How helpful would hearing aids be for someone with mild hearing loss? I'm a university student and, after two weeks of class, I'm realizing that my hearing is getting to be a problem. One of my classes is in a room with view of a major street, and there's generally a bit of traffic noise, though I really can't notice it. The issue is that its enough that I sometimes mishear the professor. This is also a class where I may need to look at something else to try and follow along with what the professor is saying, at which point I suddenly can barely hear the professor if I can hear him at all and flat out can't understand him.With other students it is vastly worse. One of the more popular meeting spaces on campus has an AC unit running constantly (yes, even in the middle of winter), and the noise from that means I quite frequently mishear people. I would estimate that I'm completely lost somewhere around a quarter to half of the time during any kind of conversation that takes place there. Recently there was a student group that met there, and, since the group fit into approximately a 15' square, it was an absolute nightmare trying to figure out what people were saying. I actually tried picking up a small megaphone and holding to my ear, and that helped with intelligibility immensely, but I still had to ensure it was pointed exactly at the person speaking, which was often not the case if the conversation moved quickly. This is what got me thinking that actual hearing aids would be potentially helpful. I also know that hearing aids are expensive, so I wanted to find out if other people have experienced a significant benefit before I actually go down that route. \n",

Hi,I am trying to find information on setting up a VERY simple computer for my Uncle who is quickly losing his vision. He have very little in the way of computer skills to begin with and I would like to get him accustom to the interface before it gets any worse.

      "Rotating Braille Generator My colleague and I are taking a microcontroller class where we're attempting to create a haptics device for our final project. The project is a PDF/text reader that outputs braille for a blind person to read. We did some research and found that 40 character refreshable braille displays are available on the market, but are priced at around 5K-15K. We wanted to make a device that is more accessible for those without thousands to spend, allowing them to apply for jobs that ask them to regularly read off the computer. Our idea simplifies the display to only output one character (6 pins), with each pin being controlled by an actuator (micro linear actuators/ micro servos?). Ideally, we wanted to create a cylinder that changes the pin configuration with every rotation. The cylinder would rotate at an appropriate speed (possibly adjustable) for the person to read without any trouble. We had a few questions about the idea and its implementation. First and foremost, do any of you believe this device can actually be of use to the blind? I was talking to our lab manager and he expressed concern with the mechanism due to the fact that the person would be reading large documents one letter at a time. We had thought that braille was meant to be read character by character, unlike English where a person can read word by word. Another issue was the complexity of the mechanical design. We were given 5 weeks to complete this project and we have little mech e knowledge (I have some experience with solidworks but that's about it). As mentioned earlier, we were considering using miniature actuators to push the pins through the 6 holes, and we were hoping to get some recommendations based on materials others have seen. Finally, are there many devices like this on the market? If you have seen many similar devices, could you suggest some other avenues we can pursue?Thanks everyone \n",

      "If eloquence/ViaVoice was open source, what features would you add to it? I was just thinking about what I’d add if it was made open source and if I had the necessary skills, so I thought it’d be interesting to start a discussion.For a start, I’d create an alternate American English voice which would differentiate between the letters d and t in the middle of words, so that, for example,  metal and medal would sound different. Even after over 20 years of using various eloquence versions it’s kind of annoying to have to occasionally  check which letter it is. The British English accent   of course does this but I’ve never got on with the overall sound of it. To me as a Brit it sounds like an American trying their best to do a generic English accent but not quite getting it.I would also try to get a team together to add more languages to it. Imagine if it could speak as many as eSpeak? The last time I checked it was close to 90 languages and dialect’s of varying levels of accuracy.I would also attempt to improve Eloquence’s  female voices. Your mileage may vary but I’ve never found them pleasant to listen to. Reed is the only one of its voices that I don’t find annoying.Finally, I’d find a way of incorporating the version that had Wade and Flo, mainly for nostalgia’s sake \n",

I don't wear the hearing aids behind my ears like most people do since I was born with no ear canals and holes, and my external ears aren't normals. I have been wearing these types of hearing aids (don't remember if they were all Oticon brand though, but same type and designs!) since I was a little (over 35 years?).

My hearing has been stable as well.  has my test results, history, Genie's numbers, etc.It has been almost a couple months since I wore my new digital Sumo DM BTE. I am still not fully used to it.

I still get some feedbacks, echoes, etc. depending on what audio I hear like very loud bassy music during church services (even if audio volume is to mininum), Forrest Gump's theme like on YouTube ( ), my clicky keyboard, etc. My audiologist and Oticon's phone technical support say that is pretty much tweaked. My audiologist said my hearing aid types can't handle mutliple audio and all types. Also, he said my hearing aid types can't be improved much because of bone conduction's technology hasn't changed over time (that explains why my new oscilliator is the same exact model as my old 380P's).

I received a pretty good response with solid advice from a number of users here (Thank you all!). For various reasons, I had to put off buying the aids until now, a year later. So here I am, asking for the same advice as last time. Has anything changed in the interim, are there newer technologies available? To summarize, I am looking for ITC/CIC options for severe-profound bilateral hearing loss.I tried two options for a few minutes each - Unitron and Phonak. I preferred the Phonak version since the sounds just seemed more natural than the Unitron. I am not getting into specific models since the trials were on BTE aids while I will be getting a comparable ITC model from whichever brand - maybe the audeo/virto q50s from Phonak. Any opinions on these? Would it be worth it to choose virto/bolero over audeo? The new audiologist I went to today suggested a brand I haven't heard of before - Audifon, specifically their Libra power CIC since they have CICs upto 120db. This is apparently an established brand. What worries me is I haven't been able to find a single review of this online and I have no idea why this is the case. Here's what I have found on Audifon so far:   [Audifon website](  [Libra CIC power data sheet](  [Old interview with Audifon's US VP]( haven't yet had the chance to try these audifons out since they weren't available today. I will be returning in a few days to do so.Does anyone have any reviews of Audifon products and any idea how this compares with the Phonak options? Also, I have yet to try any Starkey models since they are apparently not widely used here and this chain doesn't deal with them. Any suggestions on specific models would be welcome. I will be doing this as well perhaps next week.[Here's a link to the previous thread.]( 30. [Audiogram]( \n",

      "How do you handle personal space invasion? Since losing most of my vision, one issue that I'm struggling with on a daily basis is how to deal with well-meaning people touching me unexpectedly.  For example,  two of my doctors have a compulsion to take my hand right off my lap to touch or shake it.    When my signature is required, I ask them to point to the line, but many people will grab my finger and drag it to location.  I have strangers lean over me to try to put my seat belt on, and even more common, people who grab my arm unasked and unannounced, to lead me somewhere. I'm finding it tricky to find a consistent way to deal with instances like these. On one hand, I know people do these things out of kindness and compassion. On the other, it gives me the howling fantods to be touched by strangers and feeling panicked by invasion of personal space.  I would love to know how other blind or visually impaired people deal with these things. \n",

      "Low vision & ADHD house organization tips So my boyfriend (25m) has keratoconis and ADHD. He recently showed me a video that mimics what his vision looks like and I had no idea it was that bad. Our house is constantly a mess with all his clothes everywhere, but whenever I move them he freaks out because he can’t really look for them, it’s easier when they’re just all laid out so he can see everything better. There’s gotta be another way. He has a dresser but it’s always empty. He said maybe he’d hang everything, but he never got around to it. He’s basically living out of over-spilling laundry baskets that he rips apart every time he needs clothes. I was thinking those open like toy shelves, where there’s bins angled diagonal so everything’s out in the open. We know from experience he doesn’t even like pulling out bins he can’t already see into. I try to tell him if everything has a home it’ll be so much easier to find, but I also feel like I can’t say shit because I have no idea how he lives.

Eventually I want to get around to doing all of them but seeing as though I only just started, thinking about reviewing 700 games seems intense, haha!Anyhow, I'm planning on attaching closed captions along with the reviews because I'm only actually seen speaking for 10 seconds at the start of each review, and the rest is voice over work, and I don't really want to ignore a huge amount of people that will get nothing out of my reviews because of the way I've done it. I'm just wondering - In your opinion, what is the best way to go about it? I have the literal scripts of the reviews in front of me that represent the exact words that I'm saying, so nothing would be abridged if I used those, and I don't really talk fast, so speed shouldn't be a problem in any scenario, but is there any kind of standard for captions in relation to deaf communities? \n",

Thank you for your patience. =)A friend studying Linguistics and I (we are both hearing) were discussing sign language, and came upon the question of whether individuals who sign will have distinct characteristics and quirks in their signing that could be described as their \"voice,\" and therefore be recognized as uniquely their own.In the same vein, are there ways to sign that come off more stereotypically feminine/masculine/etc, or even have an \"accent\"? And finally! Does a person's style of signing change as they grow older? As in, are there more \"childish\" ways to sign that change into possibly more sophisticated styles as they age?  \n",

      "Dating while being visually impaired? For context, I’m pretty sure that I’m aroace (aromatic asexual) or at least I currently feel I am and when talking to my friend about this the other day, he asked me something that made me think, ‘do you think you find the idea of relationships unappealing because you lack the visual aspect?’. At first I said ‘no, probably not‘ because I don’t see what being visually impaired has to do with anything. Then he bought a few points that made me think. 1) I don’t look at faces because my eyes are sensitive to light and also because I don’t ever really get close enough to see them, I can know people for years before realising that I’ve never seen their face properly. 2) Not noticing peoples advances because of a lack of vision. 3) Having low confidence, I’ve always struggled with it but now more so especially because I’m experiencing some form of further sight loss. It all made me start to think, I’m 16 so I’d probably know if I liked people romantically by now but maybe being VI has made me suppress the idea of relationships.   Also, interesting side note: the boy who I had this conversation with might like me (I think) and that’s what’s really making me start think about all this and also because I don’t want to push down the possibility of having a relationship because its just to hard to figure stuff out.  Does being visually impaired make it harder to date/make people just not want to do it or is it a completely unrelated matter- I know tons of visually impaired and blind people date so I’m guessing probably not. \n",

He is very frugal and frequently gets confused memory wise. I feel there is a good possibility that he doesn't understand the options available to him fully, or that I'm just grasping at straws.Second, the man is completely unwilling to change anything, but it is getting very difficult to speak to him on the phone. The chances of getting him to text on a cell phone are zero, and he refuses to allow the internet into his house (even just for skype, been over it) as it 'opens you up to all sorts of people stealing from you'.

      "SODA's and Deaf school Hey, I'm struggling and am needing genuine advice from the Deaf community. This is coming from a place of me trying to continually learn where my place is. My daughter is Deaf - attends the local residential school. She lost her hearing progressively and had no desire to learn ASL at first, so we made the decision to get cochlear implants for her (Yes, I have immersed myself in Deaf culture the last 6 years of learning ASL and I know this is a contentious subject. This is solely so that my situation is understood so I don't need comments on it please). So her younger brother has grown up with her speaking with him because he's hearing. At the same time, I am learning ASL on my own, am currently taking classes and hope to one day be an interpreter. It wasn't until two years ago that she finally wanted to learn, and so we as a family are really trying to support her. So, when my hearing son was given the chance to go to the Deaf school with her for two years of preschool, we jumped on it.  He has struggled, and the teacher has found something new to complain about with him every day (Having accidents, getting distracted, being verbal, etc). She's stated that this is normal behavior for a 3-year-old and yet, it's always something she's bringing up around him. We've had meetings to discuss him and the principal didn't see these things as an issue, so we continued but the school has become a toxic situation. She told me in front of my son that he doesn't fit at the school and doesn't need to learn ASL since he's hearing so we should find another school. I've pushed back on this, and I've repeatedly said that it's about our family, and what's good for my daughter too, not just my son. But the last two days, the teacher is pushing back harder against my wishes for him to stay at the school.  We are at a loss now. Are we doing something wrong by pushing to have him attend class at the Deaf school? Is it frowned upon to have a hearing sibling in the Deaf school? Is the teacher right and that we shouldn't have him learn ASL from the school? I want to be an ally, and I want to support my daughter so that she has full language access at home, while also providing both my kids with the opportunity to share in a beautiful language and culture. I just don't know if I'm looking at this like a hearing person that is sorely mistaken in what's best for my Deaf child or if this is something that I need to keep pushing for. At this point it feels really disheartening and I don't know what I need to do. Any advice on the questions above, or tips on how to get my son signing at school? He'll attempt to sign with me, so it's really weird that he suddenly won't even try to sign with the teacher anymore. \n",

He took braille classes a couple decades ago and hasn't really used or retained that information. My current idea is to make braille stickers in a grid formation (example, X tape is found at Row A, Line 5). I also plan to cover all of the shelf internal surfaces with felt to help protect his fingers and the tapes from any accidents. Is there anything else I can do to help him, are there any organizational strategies you guys use accommodating large collections of things? \n",

      "Are there any blind programmers here? Hello, all. I'm a (non-blind) computer science student, and for my honors thesis I was interested in attempting to create a set of development tools for blind programmers. If there are any blind programmers here, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what sorts of tools or structures would be useful for you.My basic idea gets into a little bit of compiler theory, but it involves skipping the source code stage and having a menu and command based set of tools for operating directly on the Abstract Syntax Tree (something the compiler builds as an intermediate step towards code generation). At any point while programming, your IDE would be \"Pointed\" at some node of this tree (For instance, \"Class A/Member Variable List\", \"Class B/Method foo/Code Block Two(for Statement)\", etc. You'd then have commands for navigating the tree and local resources (\"List all member variables, List all local variables, follow referenced type, etc\").My hope is that this would mean less visual searching to find needed information or context. Does this sound at all helpful? Are there tools/writing on this I should know about?Thanks for the help! \n",

      "Did I just blow this job opportunity? I just applied for a video marketing job at a Deaf institution (I am hearing), however I realized that the reel I submitted may have a questionable line. The clip is about 3 minutes into a 5 minute reel, set in the 1960s between two scientists, and the exchange is as follows: \"Why are we shouting?\"\"Because you don't answer your phone, and I assume you are Deaf!\"My reel was made months before this job application (the clip in question was made almost 2 years ago), and I just now remembered that line was included. I was so focused on the editing of the scene I didn't even notice the script, but I don't know if that dialogue is considered offensive.I feel horrible that I may have completely ruined this amazing opportunity, and I can't relax until I get some input from the Deaf community. Is that one line offensive enough to warrant taking down the entire reel and finding an excuse to tell the hiring coordinator why it was taken down while I upload a revised version in the meantime? Or do I stand by it and (if I even get an interview at this point) express to the interviewer that part of working in production is not always agreeing with the ideas of your teammates, and although I disagree with the statement, I did my best to create the best looking video I could. Would they be able to make the distinction that the statement is not reflective of me as a person? What do I do? Any feedback is greatly appreciated, I'm heartbroken thinking I may have just ruined this for myself.EDIT: Thank you so much for your feedback, although I lost the original project file, I decided to just download the online version from youtube (hopefully won't cause too much quality loss,) remove the line, and resubmit my entire application (and add subtitles to the new version!)

      "Canute eReader source code A group called Bristol Braille Tech is trying to release a mechanically refreshable Braille eReader named the Canute. Link below. the video on the website, it appears to be about the size of a standard US keyboard with a numberpad, maybe a couple inches deep, and from the website, \"It will be 32 cells by 8 or 16 lines and cost less than a Perkins Brailler or iPad Pro.\" In addition to the cells, it has eight face buttons, four on the left and right of the lines, with a USB port on the side for ePub files and other book formats. The important part, for me at least, is that the code to the device's UI has been released to Github, meaning that it doesn't just have to be an eReader, and dedicated applications and games can be developed for it. It appears to be running on a Raspberry Pi, so there's more than enough power under the hood to be creative, and a great developer community to pull from, but it's all still specifications and prototypes right now.For the users of /r/blind, is it worth pouring new iPad or brailler money into a dedicated Braille eReader?

(I mention autism because one of the traits of her autism is that she is very sensitive to touch.)The last few weeks, I've noticed that when she comes to class, she is usually set up at one of the tables with a set of headphones and not really integrated into the class.  I want to change that. Most of the curriculum is pretty flat - coloring, gluing tissue paper to a drawing, etc.  I spoke to the person who's in charge of designing the crafts and she wasn't aware that we had a blind student - she has committed to trying to make the activities more hands-on/3D going forward.  After some preliminary research, I am going to try lining the coloring sheets with Elmer's glue to give raised edges to the drawings and I'm going to set her up with a tray so she has a defined space that she can use to keep her items so she can try to organize her space.  What else can I do to try to include her and make her time with us more beneficial?

      "ADA accommodations and being told “they will be implemented sometimes but it’s not guaranteed” I work in a restaurant with a patio. I’ve been confined to restaurants with patios for 20 years because the acoustics of a busy restaurant indoors makes my job so difficult with how many times I have to ask people to repeat themselves. Indoors I have to apologize for being hearing impaired immediately upon approaching them, and it’s honestly demeaning. I don’t want to apologize for having a disability. Recently I asked my boss to provide a reasonable accommodation that I could always have an outdoor section so I don’t have to rely 100% on lip reading. He said they can comply with that. Yesterday another boss said “that’s something we can implement sometimes, but it won’t always be the case” that’s not what I was told initially. I don’t want to have to fight to get what I’m legally entitled to and I also don’t know how to approach this other boss about it. Legally I’m entitled to this, yes the patio is better money, but sometimes it’s cold and it isn’t good money. My intention isn’t to put myself in the position to make more than everyone else there, it’s to escape the very real communication anxiety and the fact that it’s infinitely more difficult to do my job efficiently indoors. How would you word your response to boss #2 without sounding like you’re asking for favoritism, while still not humbling yourself to the point that you have to thoroughly explain just how difficult the acoustics indoors makes it for me to work well? \n",

      "So my bio parents are learning to fingerspell (and eventually will learn ASL) for me... Background: I have a processing disorder (resulting from a traumatic brain injury) that renders me functionally profoundly HoH in certain situations (crowds, background noise, thick accents, etc.). I get by okay-ish with lip reading in those situations, but it's a struggle, especially since I'm a newbie. Since getting my diagnosis this past summer, I've re-learned the manual alphabet, and I'll be starting ASL classes in the fall.I just reconnected with my birth parents (I was adopted from birth) a month ago, and I'll be visiting them for a week in March. They know the details of how my CAPD affects me. I told them to face me when they talk, move somewhere quieter (if possible) when it's crowded/noisy, etc., etc. A couple weeks ago, my bio dad informed me out of the blue that he was going to learn the manual alphabet (bio mom already knows it). A few days later, he'd could sign the alphabet from memory, and he told me he was working on practicing actual words and sentences so they can more easily communicate with me when it's crowded. My bio mom is headed back to school for a second bachelor's degree, and he work is covering the cost of certain courses, and she worked it so she can take ASL! My (adoptive) parents would never do something like this. Don't get me wrong, they're great parents. But they just don't seem to fully comprehend how much my CAPD fucks with my ability to understand what's going on. Also, I think my (adoptive) mum believes I'm greatly exaggerating things. She rolls her eyes whenever I mention my difficulty understanding what people are saying. She doesn't really understand that, yes, I can understand her from across the living room if it's dead silent and she's speaking clearly, but if we're in the laundry room with the washer and dryer on, I get 0% of what she's saying. She just doesn't fully get it, and she's really bad at remembering to face me, talk louder, etc. I don't really resent her for it; I know she's got a lot on her plate, and it's a bit of an adjustment. I'm just telling you this to provide context for how much my bio parents' efforts mean to me.I'm absolutely **floored**. This is the first time anyone in my life has done this. My friends just use pen-and-paper when it gets noisy, or they wait til we're in a quieter space (understandable--I can't just foist a whole new language on people). I never expected anybody to do something like this, let alone these people I just reconnected with. I feel... I dunno, validated? that these people think it's worth all the hassle to make things a bit easier or more comfortable for me. I'm not sure how to describe what I'm feeling right now. For the first time since noticing I had a problem and getting seen/diagnosed, *I don't feel self-conscious*. I don't feel like a phony. I don't feel like I have to prove myself to them. Them being so cool about it and understanding and accommodating is making me feel at peace in a way that I didn't think was going to happen. I'm honestly tearing up a little as I type this.I have a feeling I'm not going to feel one bit of embarrassment if I ever have to ask them to slow down, or repeat something, or finger spell it, or write it down, or wait til it's quieter. Cause they get it. Instead of me having to do all the work to understand, they want to meet me partway. And it's not something I'm having to twist their arms over. They *volunteered*.I don't feel like \"feex3 who has issues hearing/understanding\" when I talk to them. I feel like plain old feex3.Sorry this is so long. I just really wanted to share with some people who might get what I'm feeling right now. \n",

      "What job options are available for me, as a college student in desperate need for work? Advice, answers and suggestions are welcomed. Well, here is a brief description about myself, which may or may not help you give me the advice, answers, and suggestions that I need. I was born hearing, but became deaf at 6 years old due to a illness. I received my cochlear implant about a year later. My parents were (and still are against the Deaf community and sign languages). As a result, I grew up in a hearing world - I attended a Oral school for the deaf and hard-of-hearing to learn to \"speak perfectly\" and to strengthen my listening skills, with the help of my CI. After staying at the oral school for a few years, I later was mainstreamed. It was not until I was 19 years old (I'm currently 22) when I decided I wanted to be part of the Deaf Community, so, I started taking ASL classes and went to all of the Deaf events that my area had to offer. I was able to acquire ASL quickly, and it is now a language I am the most comfortable using. I currently have my Associate's Degree in Early Childhood Education, which I obtained with High Honors. Perhaps I am not giving myself enough credit, but I feel I do not have much work experience. I spent most of my community college years supporting myself (while living with my parents) through my private pet-sitting services. I've also done almost 2 years of ASL tutoring at my local community college. This is the only paid jobs that I've experienced so far. I've also done some volunteer work during the summer working at a school for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. I am moving down to Southern California in the Los Angeles & Orange County area at the end of the month to attend school at CSU Northridge part-time for now. I need to find work ASAP because I need to pay for bills. So, here is a list of my questions: 1) Where can I work? I am looking into working for retail stores such as Walmart, Target, Walgreens, etc. I am a little nervous that being deaf may get in the way of using some of the work equipment, such as Walkie-Talkies. I know of the ADA, and I know that employers cannot legally not hire me because I am Deaf, but, it does not mean that the employers won't lie.2) During the interview process, should I reveal that I am Deaf right away? (Keep in mind I can understand most voices and speak very well since I am post-lingually Deaf.) Should I risk not being able to understand the interviewer's voice (I struggle with accents and extremely deep voices) and request a interpreter? 3) Where else can I work that I have not though of yet? I've been trying to find jobs as a ASL tutor but no luck yet. 4) Are there any programs that I can qualify for in order to receive financial assistance? My biggest fear is not being able to find work in at least 2 months.  \n",

      "Let's talk about creating a campaign to caption the upcoming political debates so they are accessible. Let's face it, the live captioning of the first political debate was atrocious and it is commonplace for videos that get put on the internet not to be captioned. Not to mention that it isn't the same to read a transcript the next day. You miss out on a lot of body language information and how things were said.So, I want to start a campaign within this subreddit to caption every political debate and put it on Youtube so it is accessible. Deaf people deserve A) equality in access and B) the opportunity to make informed decisions and informed opinions about candidates.

      "Nadia Q90 UP battery life? Hi, all,I have a question regarding the battery life of the Hearing aid I have currently.My previous hearing aid was the previous gen of Nadia (S?, I'll have to look when I get home), and I'm pretty sure it was the SP version since it only took a size 13 battery. Battery life ranged from 5 -9 or so days depending on the brand and how much I wore it.Well I just got my new Nasia Q90 UP a two weeks ago, and I'm still using the battery (675)  the audiologist put in originally, so it's been surprising, especially since I wear it for at least., 13-15 hours per day, at the normal setting he set it at.So I guess my question is, what's the average that this battery lasts, and can I continue to expect this range? I can't really find any straight answers on this.A helpful note-- the audiologist gave me two packs of power one p675 batteries to use with this hearing aid, so that's what I'm assuming he put in. \n",

I am functionally blind.\" \"Oh yeah, wow you totally wouldn't be able to see that.\" And he just sat their in bewilderment as he tried to process how I could just exist and live my life with low vision. To me its gotten to a point it's weird to remember normal people can see things like that. I can see well enough to tell there's an object in front of me and not walk into it. Honestly it doesn't feel like I need much vision beyond that in life. But sighted people just can conceptualize living with low vision. I find it really amusing. \n",

      "Can you help me look for silence? Hey!I'm Linus, a first year student at the Royal Academy of Arts in Belgium. For a project, I'm collecting silences and putting them on a blog. The goal is to eventually put them on a CD or tape, so you can listen to silence whenever you want. For more information, visit  .Also on the blog is a Silent Manifesto, a text I wrote about looking for silence. I had the idea that it would be interesting if someone who knew sign language (any sign language), could translate the text and send me a video- or audio-recording of him/her doing it. The text about silence thus gets converted back into silent gestures.Does anyone want to help me? All contributions are welcome.

      "Does it matter when you identify as d/Deaf or Hard of Hearing? hello everyone! I am curious to have your input onto this. I have heard that if you let people (whether it be meeting people online, in person, getting interview and so on)  know, you are \"d/Deaf\" they will automatically assume you do not know how to talk and you can only sign. But if you use the term \"hard of hearing\" they will assume that you can speak but cannot hear well. Is this assumption true when considering what you identify as?For example, I personally prefer saying Deaf when I have to let other people know that I have hearing loss because it just feels more natural for me. I do not rely on sign language as my primary form of communication is lip reading and speaking.Please let me know what you think! Thank you :) \n",

      "Screen reader users: reading languages which have no speech synthesiser or Braille table for. For context, I am a disabled screen reader user, I'm only fluent in English but I like learning about other languages.So, if you use a screen reader but need to read a language that no one has developed a speech synthesiser for yet, how do you get on? As a few examples, to my knowledge there's no speech synthesiser that can speak Fijian,  Samoan or Yoruba. Do you put up with an English voice butchering the language in question, or use one that supports a sort of related language? I suppose it depends on the one in question. E.G I know eSpeak can speak Estonian, but I've heard of people using Finnish TTS engines to read it, probably because of eSpeak doing a poor job. And I imagine you could probably get away with using a Dutch voice to read Frisian, or an Italian one to read the various dialects like Neapolitan.Then what about languages that don't use the Latin alphabet. I was going to use Tibetan as an example but I've just found a speech synth for it. I don't know anything about Tibetan so can't say if it's any good or not, but I'll post a link in the comments for anyone that might be interested.I guess if you have a Braille display and there's a Braille table for a language you don't have a speech synthesiser for, or you are deaf blind, then that's always an (or the only) option. But what if there's no Braille table either for the language  you want to read?Speaking of eSpeak, it's amazing how many  languages that thing can speak, or at least make an attempt of. If it carry's on like that, it probably will end up supporting every language in the world. Give it a look regardless of what you think of it.Hope that makes any sense. I tend to ramble. \n",

      "[Rant] I'm so sick of everything. EVERYTHING. So to give some background information: I have a CI in my right ear since the age of 7. Now with speech-language therapy, I can hear pretty well. For a long time, I have a huge problem with socialization. I'm always lonely because no matter how much I attempt to socialize with new people, they *never* come up to me unless I initiate a conversation. And if that ever happens, why does it have to be me?!?!?!?!?!?!I have a small class of 11 people. This lasts for the entire year. So in the beginning of the year, I went up to some of the people and socialized with them but I've noticed that they do not *initiate* a conversation with me. Instead it just has to be me. What I have observed is that one person in the same group would talk to someone sitting next to them but that never happens to me. Instead the person to my right or left instead talks to someone else. before I started this class, everyone told me positive reviews about it. I was constantly told that you would become \"best friends\" with everyone in the class but fuck no, I even see them as my opponents. This is why I have such strong resentment towards them. Last week, the same group organized an event to go out for dinner. I of course declined because this year proved to me that talking to them was ineffective. No one seemed to care about me. So I didn't go. I have been in therapy and the counsellor is fantastic. He can emphasize with my problems and the fact that my hearing loss makes socialization much harder. Nevertheless, he has been pushing me to go out and socialize. I have to push myself and I agree with that but damn it, it's just hard when no one wants to take an interest in YOU even if YOU were the one who took the initiative.End of rant.

      "Is there a double tap timeout feature on android similar to the feature voiceover has on the iPhone?   Hello all, as a follow-up to my post this morning I was wondering if anyone uses Double tap timeout on the iPhone and has switched to android.   It seems quite likely that I will be switching over to android because there seems to be a consensus that it’s speech to text features are superior to iPhones.   I was wondering, has anyone made use of voiceovers double tap timeout feature on the iPhone and switched over to android successfully?.For people who don’t know, double tap timeout is a feature in voiceover that will let you increase the time in between your taps on the iPhone to enable you to still activate an item if you aren’t able to double tap quickly enough for voiceover to register that you have in fact done a double tap. For me, I can’t tap my phone quickly enough, so I couldn’t activate buttons without this feature. The alternative is that I do a split tap with everything which means I must physically locate the item I wish to activate.I would like to know if a similar feature exists on android? If you have switched over to android from iPhone and been a user of this feature of voiceover, how you found the transition and do you still find it to be accessible? \n",

If someone is natural born deaf, never heard a sound before, what's the thinking language inside of his/her brain?It may be \"the learned written language, like English\". But there's conflict here, if I'm thinking with sound in my mind, then it's ok. But deaf-born people doesn't imagine sound in brain, right?On the other hand it may be a sign language which is very hard to understand by hearing people*. Using shapes, colors, signs (like math), senses etc. But this kind of thinking is very interesting to me. I'm trying to understand it.Thinking in sign language even may make people \"quick thinker\". let's take the example of simple math equations. if I do 11+8=19 calculation in my head, I both visiualise the numbers and read them loud in my head. So, that means I think twice. The sound in the brain is a total time waster.I can't imagine \"thinking\" activity without sound in my brain.What're your opinions or experiences on this?*edit note: \"normal people\" phrase is replaced with \"hearing people\" above.

First off, while having access to a larger screen or integrated stand is neat, it falls flat on the accessibility front.

      "How to approach hearing who are misusing ASL? (slight rant) For some context, I attend a completely hearing university, where I am the only Deaf student. There is one girl who continually thinks it is okay for her to do ASL interpretation and perform ASL poetry, even though she has only taken one class. She has no relation whatsoever to Deaf culture. In fact after a few conversations I found she has never even spoken to a Deaf person besides me and has no awareness of the culture. She does these in front of huge audiences and gets a ton of praise, but makes many mistakes and does not understand the cultural repercussions and how it gives a false representation. It's not even ASL, the grammar is completely \"speaking grammar\". But she goes around claiming to be an advocate and ASL interpreter. When I tried approaching her about this she got very upset with me and called me oversensitive, claiming she was just trying to be inclusive. I understand her good intentions, but I don't feel completely comfortable being at a university where people think it is okay to use American Sign Language as a cool hobby for their art. How do I approach this? Am I being too sensitive? What should I do if this continues to happen? Just looking for some guidance from y'all !Edit: Thank you for all the kind replies and advice! Sorry if I did not respond to you. I have read everyone's words and will think more about how exactly I should approach this situation.

To my knowledge, I was one of the first, if not the first, to create a Twitter account called @BlindieProblems back in November 2011 solely for this purpose. However, it seems a few others have jumped on the bandwagon, and I also found that I no longer merely discussed \"problems.\" Blind humor is still my main gig, but I also post advocacy or current events things from time to time. Anyway, feel free to have a look see, as it were. ;) \n",

      "My grandma is going blind, I want to make a computer for her. She will not be able to look at any screen and probably not learn any non-trivial interface. My thought is to create some very simple controller with three or four buttons. Something like right,middle,left button. Anyway, my question is what kind of programs/tools can be useful. Currently my thoughts are simple stuff like tell the time and date, weather and maybe some game to pass her time. Maybe like trivia with three options. As text-to-speach in her language is too poor she won't be able to get internet news, but maybe I could record some weather information or specific webradio shows.So again, I am looking for tips on tools/programs that would be helpful. I will implement this all myself as a summer project, so all ideas are welcome. \n",

      "Grandmother's hearing aid not working? Hello, My grandmother has bad hearing (due to age) and has had hearing aid for the past two years. The last device didn't work well at all, and I had to scream at her from a feet's distance for her to hear. She recently got a new one, which works a bit better but all in all it's the same story. My questions are: 1. Are hearing aids usually this bad or should they almost \"restore\" the hearing capability? (Or is it normal that they help this little?)2. Is there something that can be done about it? I imagine there are some \"volume settings\" (excuse my naive wording) on the device? Maybe they are set very low the first time around, and then adjusted in the next meeting with the \"hearing doctor\" (excuse me, again). FYI: I know absolutely nothing about hearing aids or hearing impairment, so please bear with me and let me know if there's any further information you need. I appreciate any help, as it would help both my family and grandmother A LOT! \n",

I now wear aids, but within the last 2 years, they stopped helping. If I'm not wearing my hearing aids, I can't hear anything. With them, I can hear ambient sounds, but it's challenging to hear anyone. I have to rely more on lip-reading now to communicate.My parents are both hearing impaired also, my mother can't hear at all without hearing aids. My dad can, but he can't hold a conversation without his. Neither use asl.The only thing I've heard about the deaf community is that it can be very unforgiving. So in an effort to avoid offending anyone, I'm curious when it's generally acceptable to refer yourself as \"deaf\"? My doctors call me profoundly deaf, and most people in the hearing world correct me when I call myself deaf. Apparently since I can hear with hearing aids, I'm not deaf?I know I can call myself whatever I want at the end of the day, but doing things correctly and respectfully is important to me. Within a few years my hearing will be gone entirely, so being respectful of the deaf community is a priority.TLDR: when is it socially acceptable to call yourself deaf? \n",

      "The Advocates Network Join “The Advocates” where Deaf and DeafBlind athletes ***in adaptive sports*** meet and formulate a more complete network. The meetings are open to allies of ASL (including Protactile) in any US state. Too often we see disabled athletes experiencing deafness in “adaptive spaces,” that are not included and are left totally isolated (*ADA Title II, undue financial hardship). This is a network to support ASL or other means of accessibility for those who have gone without, in whatever capacity possible (*because there is no legal responsibility in certain instances, particularly outside of college). This is a place that I hope becomes a collective for advocacy for those who are left out of the conversation. Allies be they interpreters, people from the community, sports leadership, nonprofits- are all welcome. This is a group for adults. The bigger of a pool we can create, the more opportunities we’ll have to influence social change and awareness. In this space Deaf disabled and DeafBlind start and end a conversation, members must respect each other but especially anyone culturally Deaf and disabled including DeafBlind. This is not a class for hearing people to learn ASL, if you are seeking that class, please conduct your own research. This is a hub for everyone to meet and have productive discussions so the landscape of adaptive sports can change to be more inclusive of Deaf!  \n",

      "Hey everyone! I need feedback on a design we made for hearing impaired/deaf people as part of a school assignment! Hey guys and girls!As part of a project called: Designing for a specific target group, we decided to make a product to help people who have hearing loss or are deaf (mainly people with hearing loss). We developed a product (concept name: ViBelt) to help people with hearing loss in conversations and on the street to locate where sound is coming from. It is a belt with microphones and buzzers. Once sound is detected from behind (say someone approaches you in your back and says \"Hi\") it gives a buzz in the direction the sound is coming from. This project is based on a case study on my dad, who has been living with damaged ears since he was 1 year old. He has trouble locating sounds if he doesn't see where they are coming from, for instance when someone talks to him (he taught himself to read lips, so thats why he can follow a conversation when he sees the people talking) or when a cyclist rings his bell from behind.Here is a video describing what it should do (first 20 secs describe my dad's situation and problems, the rest shows how our product should function):  you're interested here's our other video showing our project progress so far, it contains the scenario's we think our product should function in:  . It is in Dutch, but scenario 1 is; \"Getting spoken to without eye contact\" and scenario 2 is; \"Alarming sounds from behind\". Tell me what you think! Is this something more people experience and do you think this product concept could help? Is it better to focus only on the conversation part or is the help in say traffic more important?All help is apreciated, because the only one we know with this problem is my dad, and that's not enough to base a design on ;)Thanks!Daan DriessenStudent Industrial DesignUniversity of Twente - NL \n",

The white cane has helped me quite a lot because I can still see but my remaining vision is not the best. So the cane has given me much more independence. I’ve known about guide dogs for a while now and many people have recommended that I apply for one.I have been told the process can take a few years and requires a bit of training. One must be able to navigate independently on their own before they can be eligible for a guide dog. Since I have only just started cane training, I don’t think I am independent enough at the moment. I feel like I would like a guide dog some time in the future but don’t feel ready right now. At the same time, I know the process will take time as well. I don’t know if I should apply now and work on my cane skills or apply for the guide dog after. My counselor told me that O&M is an ongoing process and there is never a point at which you can fully master cane travel. He says I should apply as soo. As possible. Once I apply, is there a way to withdraw my application? Will the organization (in my case Guide Dogs For The Blind) tell me if I’m not eligible/independent enough for the dog? \n",

      "Struggling with identity, suddenly Hi /r/blind. The title says a lot of it, I suppose. Let me elaborate a bit further. So basically, my optic nerve is supposedly in shreds. This is called hypoplasia? It sounds like it. It was noticed at aIn early age. Apparently I was lousy at ball sports, and I was wheeled off for checkups. Turns out there was a good reason for that. I´ve heard a few different things said during my life, but the most certain is probably that my sight unaided was 6/60 (I think this is 20/200 in the US) during my teens. So.. I found out that some could be corrected via LASIK. Near-sightedness, and a few other things. It was done, and I'm very happy about the result. This was done about five years ago now. Apparently, I'm now at 20/50 (US). 40% vision.And.. These days, I find that I'm struggling a bit with identity. Aside (or because of) the hypoplasia, I have a case of nystagmus as well. So even though things have gotten a lot better, I still fumble around. I still miss things, I'm anxious when out eating - not always being able to find bathrooms, not recognizing people.. Those things. I strain. I look awkward in my null position, trying to amke the world stop moving for just a second. Last try at education failed horribly, due to not being able to work fast enough because of all these things.So.. I spent the last couple of days with some wonderful people at a danish institute called IBOS, who provide and assist us with instructions, tools, courses on how to deal with things, not always being able to see them. And basically.. All of these other people were rather worse off than myself. Yet, I still use visual aids. At least.. After this, I do. They're making things easier for me. Much easier. And the things we were provided will especially help during school, for the next years. But still.. I just feel like I'm falling somewhere between two chairs. I don't know why it bothers me so much, but it does. And I don't know what I'm expecting from this post, but I at least needed to tell someone.I'm 29 and male, in case someone is interested in those things. \n",

      "Can someone explain statutory blindness based on visual field testing? I am confused! S I have Stargardt disease. I was recently at the doc and had some tests. Best corrected acuity is 20/40, both eyes (I am very lucky that I still have some vision in my fovea).She said I was \"legally blind\" based off my visual field test. I know that a MD of -22 equates to \"low vision\", not statutory blindness (I am at -23.5, and -24.8). However, I do not understand the SSA definition of statutory blindness:> b. The Act also provides that an eye that has a visual field limitation such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees is considered as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less. (For visual field testing requirements, see 2.00A6.)[Here]( is where they explain how they figure if you have statutory blindness. I am confused.I have some vision in fovea, but on HFA 30-2 and Octopus, I have no vision in the central 36 degrees of vision (18 degrees radius around the point of fixation), and gradually increasing vision outwards from that point. Is this classified as statutory blindness?I ask because I currently earn too much $ to apply under low vision, but if I have statutory blindness I am able to apply.Thank you if anyone can further explain this to me. I know, I should have asked the doc to explain better, but I didn't run into questions until I started researching. \n",

      "Hearing Aid time So, I have an appointment for June 11th to speak to the audiologist about a hearing aid. I've had progressive hearing loss for the past 10 years due to Chronic Mastoid Disease, basically an inflammation behind the mastoid bone. It has caused not only the loss of hearing, but also constant eardrum perforation and infection. The doc finally told me last week that if I wanted to be able to hear in that ear again, a hearing aid would be my only option,since the chance of surgery to repair the hole in my eardrum has such a low chance of success. It is going to be super weird to be able to hear out of that ear again.  \n",

      "How do you best like to experience Extended Audio Descriptions of video media? Hello,I wanted to ask about your experiences listening to extended audio descriptions of media. I am working on a very large gig writing extended audio descriptions for a series of education videos/documentaries for a heritage foundation that gets money from the government to produce their media and have it be accessible for all. As you probably know, extended descriptions have the video paused while the voice over describes what is about to be on screen in the video and then un-pauses letting the video play. This is in contrast to regular AD where voice over is snuck into the spaces in the media. (I clarify this as last time I brought this up some blind people on this sub hadn't heard of extended AD, it seems to be a niche thing). Apologies if I am over explaining, just want to make it clear what I am working on. My client wants me to write and record a description for every single image that is displayed on the screen, but it seems to me this is way too much information and would just end up being incredibly annoying/monotonous to a blind person listening. The nature of these videos is that they use lots of repeated photographs and the same speakers or shown on the screen repeatedly. It seems unnecessary to have the Voice Over every single shot. For example: tell you that a certain man is shown speaking to the camera every single time he is shown. Or another example is when multiple different angles of the same subject is shown. It seems to me you'd rather... \"various angles of the inside a church\" rather than me describing every shot specifically. Much of the script, and therefore the voiceover, doesn't really add any important context to the content of the film. And therefore, when I listen with my eyes closed, it comes off as patronizing. As if the listener couldn't figure out what was on screen by just listening to regular audio. Anyway, I just want to get a blind person's take on this. This gig seems very much like it was a government rule enacted to make video accessible (which is great!), but the execution isn't taking the actual needs of blind people into account. They are just satisfying the conditions in order to get the grant. Or maybe I am completely off base and you'd rather have everything described. Thoughts? \n",

I was walking down the sidewalk in downtown Chicago with my cane and a girl, 7 or 8, passed me. She got in front of me, turned around, looked me right in the eye and stopped. I halted and did not hit her with my cane. She smiled to herself and walked on. Thought it was too funny to get mad at.At the airport it was crowded and I ran into a guy in a wheelchair.

      "Idea for new accessibility tool Hi! I am part of a mechanical engineering design team at Purdue University. Our team is aiming to make a product that will help visually impaired people and anyone working somewhere where sight is limited. We want to make sure that the product we are designing is useful, so we are looking for outside help.  Our hand-held product uses a distance sensor to see obstacles at different distances (up to 4 meters) in front of the user. This sensor data would then be translated to a set of small pins in a grid, two rows back and four rows across. The front row would raise to show close obstacles and the back would show farther ones. Similarly, the right side of the pins will show obstacles on the right, center will show center, and left will show left. Lastly, pins will raise and lower to indicate the relative size/height of the obstacles, including lowering to show a step down. A finger can be rested on the pins which will allow for the user to feel where an obstacle is located. In the case of an obstacle that appears suddenly, the device will generate a vibration to alert the user. This is designed to be used either with or in replacement of a white cane or guide dog. With that being said, our group would like input on how the community feels about this device. Do you think this could be useful? What are some things you would like to see in this product? Additionally, please let us know if you would be willing to be interviewed for this project. We appreciate your time and consideration. Thanks! \n",

      "Professor/Student: looking for suggestions of authors or collections in book form that look closely at how language is acquired, how second languages are acquired, and how that process should be understood by teachers of deaf students. (crossposted). I am a PhD candidate and Junior faculty member. In the spring I am going to be teaching a graduate level Language Acquisition class that has a strong focus on second language acquisition for deaf students.I am looking for a textbook that would supplement my course. I am already planning on using Gunther Kress' (2010) book: \"Multimodality: A social semiotic approach to contemporary communication\" which focuses on how non-language communication (semiotics) clarified our views of how people actually learn language.My essential question is this: **what textbooks clearly and critically explain the language acquisition process for teachers in training?**  I am a fan of James Gee's (2004) \"Situated language and learning: a critique of traditional schooling\" and also Lourdes Ortega's (2009) book: \"Understanding second language learning\" but I am not 100% sure either book does what I want it to do, especially w/r/t learning non-spoken languages (i.e. sign language).This course is the only one in the program that really digs into the nuances of language acquisition, though the other core classes feature \"language learning\" in a variety of ways, and from multiple perspectives.I am looking for suggestions of authors or collections in book form that look closely at how language is acquired, how second languages are acquired, and how that process should be understood by teachers of deaf students. I am asking this community because I want to pick a book that is accessible, user-friendly, with engaging writing, but also one that is up-to-date on the nuances of learning language as explained by contemporary theorists--Pennycook, Rampton, Matsuda, etc.I know its a long shot, but I would feel remiss not asking this community.

      "Possibly have genetic eye condition leading to blindness Hi all! Just looking for some opinions. My mom has stargartds and I’m being told I may have a mutation of it. My mom was diagnosed in her early 20s and was legally blind 10years later. When she found out it was very sudden, she always had poor vision and went to the doctor yearly, one year she showed up for the appointment and she was told that her eyes looked so different and soon found out her diagnosis. Back when she was diagnosed they said she could not pass it to her children and they didn’t give her genetic testing. Now on to me. I have gone to the eye doctors once a year since I was about 6, and I’ve always had the same eye doctor up until last year when he retired. When I filled in my new optometrist on my moms history he said he would look a little longer. He told me he saw slight speckles in my peripheral vision and sent me to a specialist.They told me the same thing (also took pictures but didn’t have a chance to look at my appt) he said the speckling could be an early indicator that I have a mutation of my moms genes that will cause me to loose peripheral vision. But it could also just be because I am fair skinned and mean nothing. My mom and I got generic tested and it will be about 2 months to get the results. I have a visual field coming up soon. In addition to this my vision has for sure been decreasing to the point where I do not feel okay with driving in the dark or even at dusk. sometimes everything goes hazy, almost like I am looking at everything through heat waves. I am also very sensitive to light and the sensitivity is increasing . I’m well aware my eyes worsening could be “normal” though and not a sign of eye disease. I guess I just want opinions because the optometrists think it’s plausible but my mom is denying it all saying this is a waste of time (maybe she’s just nervous/scared). If I will go blind I’m not afraid of that, my mom lives a good life and I know I could to, I just dont like all the waiting and suspense of being in the dark.

      "Vulnerable post… My son is 5 and Deaf/HoH. I am currently learning ASL and trying more and more to expose him to the deaf community because I strongly feel it’s his right to know more people that have similar life experiences and a shared language. He is also autistic and is having a bit of trouble picking up signs. I feel a huge responsibility in this because we didn’t start ASL until ~ 2 years ago. For reference, we are in Canada and when he was first born it was really pushed on us to pick either spoken English or ASL and weren’t really educated on ASL or using both or just one. 18 months ago, I gave birth to his twin brothers. They are using English and ASL interchangeably, and I would even say are learning at a more rapid rate than his brother. I know a part of this is definitely because he is autistic, but I also think he was deprived from a full language for so long that it’s much much harder for him now. I really really want to learn ASL as a family and hopefully become fluent. We have teachers and I take some classes but I think I need more immersion. Is it wrong for me to want to make a friend fluent in ASL? I don’t want anyone to feel like I’m using them because that’s really not my intention, but I’m still learning and obviously think it would help.

Of course I accommodated her so I could be a good person and roommate, but growing up culturally Deaf, many people in my social circle never made an issue of my being unable to hear or whether I made noise.First she once came out of her room to tell me to lower the noise, and even though my cochlear implants were off I knew that’s what she was telling me about.  We’ve kept discussing ways I can make less noise since then.  I bought wooden stirrers for coffee, then she bought wooden cutlery, both of which weren’t a problem.  But the other day we both agreed that I would wear my cochlear implants so I could pay attention to what specific noises I might have made.

I’m 27M and my mom has late onset stargardts. She was diagnosed about 4 years ago at 52 and it has luckily been progressing very slowly. I haven’t gotten a genetic test because I don’t want to spend time stressing about it coming if it’s positive. Now I’m having vision problems and stressing anyway. I’ve had to take several long drives in the past few weeks, and I noticed my vision is significantly worse. I wasn’t driving much in the past year before that (cheaper to take the bus than pay for parking at work), so I hadn’t really noticed a problem. It’s worsened to the point that I don’t feel comfortable driving somewhere I’m unfamiliar with because I can’t read the signs from a normal distance. I’ve always been nearsighted but my vision hasn’t changed much since my teens. It might also be worth mentioning that I had a change in my color vision at age 15, but at the time it was attributed to migraine medication I was taking. It wasn’t anything huge, but there was a slight loss in blue yellow vision.I know I need to make an appointment with an optometrist, but I’m terrified. I haven’t told anyone about this. I know vision loss isn’t the end of the world, but it would be the end of my career as I know it. Im a biochemist and my lab work is highly dependent on my vision. Ironically, I worked in a lab researching macular degeneration prior to my moms diagnosis. It almost feels like I jinxed it…Thank you if you read all of that.

One year (I don't remember which) there was a story told in the 1st person about a girl who met and befriended a deaf girl. Two things that stick out to me are:1. There is an illustration in the story of the two characters looking at each other. One is holding a basketball or a kickball, and the other has her arm casually out of the frame, breaking the 4th wall. Her hand grabs the frame and her elbow hangs down. Or maybe she is leaning on the frame.2. At one point in the story, the girls are being too loud and the deaf girl's mom comes in the room, signing at them to keep it down. The main character says \"It was funny seeing her yell at us in sign language.\"Does anyone know what this story is? \n",

How should I keep my battery charged: bring my charger / disposable individual batteries / both? It generally takes 1-1/2 hours to charge a battery with the charger. They last for 2.5 days. Batteries where you replace individually them are 2 at a time and disposable and last as long but generally are more expensive than using the rechargeable2. Do you suggest I bring up my back up cochlear or leave it at home. I'm thinking at home, but bringing some basic things like hooks because they are cheap3. Are people in Europe generally open and friendly towards disabled persons / hard of hearing members? 4. Is it easy to pick up 675 zinc air blue tab batteries in stores in Europe? I ask because I wonder how easy it'll be to get more if they are stolen / lost / etc5.

Hi, my daughter now 10 has had a strabismus since birth, it has been corrected to a central position 3 times via patching but as soon as patching stops the strabismus returns within 4 weeks. Each time it has changed from inwards to outwards then back to inwards. After her last patching the opthamologist said no more patching despite her eye still being outward. There have been many issues with her vision along the way and has a current prescription of +10in her poorer eye and plus +8.75 in her stronger eye. Tests have shown she has no binocular,3d or depth perception which was to be expected due to the strabismus, the tests also showed she has heavily reduced pherperal vision. She also suffers chronic migraines especially when reading  and writing  and sensitive to light. Recently she is complaining of constant double vision which is also affecting her migraines and mobility as she misjudges where the objects are. Her opthamologist has tried contact lenses to improve pherperal vision but this didn't work and  the opthamologist has said  it is a communication issue between the brain and eye, but hasn't said if this can be rectified or not. How will this double vision affect her long term or will it settle down? Is there  treatment to stop it?

      "Looking for Participants for a Linguistic Study Hi!I am an Undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, studying linguistics, and I'm required for a class to propose and perform an experiment on syntax in languages. I'm extremely interested in sign language and deaf culture, and am trying to study syntax in American Sign Language. For this experiment, I will need at least eight participants, each of which must:*be fluent in American Sign Language*Be able to read American English*Have learned ASL before learning a spoken language*Have been deaf since birth*Would be comfortable either coming to UMD or contacting me via skype/Google hangouts/other video chat methodsThe study will take no more than an hour or two, and does not have to be completed all in one sitting. It's very simple, just signing and writing sentences. I won't need any personal information, other than language/auditory history, in fact I can use your reddit username or even just a random number to identify you.Please let me know if you or anyone you know might be interested in this study!EDIT: I should note that this study won't be taking place until November! It's an end of semester project, I have to do the proposal in two weeks, and since I'm using outside subjects (not in the Linguistics program) I have to have them before the proposal! \n",

      "Strobing smoke detectors? Hi y’all! In the next few weeks I’ll be moving to a new house and wanted to get at least four smoke detectors with strobe lights (one for the sitting room, one for the office, and one each for my deaf brother’s and my bedrooms). The other two can be audible detectors for my hearing family members’ rooms. At our current place we don’t have any smoke detectors because we use a wood stove in the winter, so you can imagine how annoyed the hearies would get every time we opened the stove door haha. I’ve looked around on Amazon a bit for strobing detectors but it seems all I can find are the add-ons to wire into the audible ones—meaning I have to spend wayyyyyy more money than hearing people would. I would really like to have smoke detectors that have a strobe light built in rather than having to purchase additional sets, but I understand if there aren’t any other options. Anyone know of a good brand? \n",

He currently is using a Windows 8 desktop with a program called \"Window Eyes\" and is having a lot of problems. The computer he has is kind of cheap. I don't even know if it's dual-core.

We arent broken, society is broken. I’m sorry guys, i am terrible at explaining things.

Guy in suit then begins his fruitless attempt to start a conversation with me. Panic slightly, then shift to position myself for a clear view of his lips and hope for the best. It's a disaster.

Okay... no biggie, folks do this all the time. Normally, I'd be sad but this time I was perfectly okay with being ignored. After all, dude was missing several teeth (lipreading nightmare). I return to the comfort of my book. Some stops later there is movement in my peripheral vision. He's trying to say something. Groan. Here we go again. I look at his lips. He seems to be saying something about money? It registers. He's asking me if I need money (?????). I politely decline. I'm deaf not a charity case wtf. He pulls out his wallet, takes out two ten dollar bills and offers them to me (??????). Dude, $20 can't even begin to cover the headache you're giving me right now. He says please take it. I say NO. Audibly. I'm getting really annoyed at this point. Guy puts the money back in his wallet and pulls out his carry-on. Everyone is staring by now. I'm fuming. I move to another seat.

      "Should a deaf American/German child be raised quadrilingual? So I am an American and my husband is German and we live in Germany. We have a baby who we planned to raise bilingual until we discovered recently that she is deaf. She will likely receive cochlear implants when she is old enough. We were already planning to teach her baby signs before we found out she is deaf, but now we would like to learn German and American sign languages so she can grow up knowing both the hearing and deaf languages of her cultures. Currently I only speak English to our baby and my husband exclusively speaks German to her. If she were to learn both sign languages as well, should we start with only German sign language, or introduce both German and American sign language right away? Or should we start by using baby signs with her and only expose her to German sign language once she goes to preschool? If anyone here is experienced with quadrilingualism, I would be very happy to learn about your experience.

I just realized the other day that I've been ignorant of your needs as well. I am just curious as to the issues that blind people face with accessibility online.Deaf people are currently fighting to get subtitles added to videos on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, any major news website. I would like to see how or if the needs of blind and deaf people can be parallel even though the two senses are very different.  1) Do you feel like you're being left out of the loop online? If so, how can we make your experience better? What would be your ideal websurfing experience? An ideal websurfing experience for a deaf person is if all videos were captioned or transcribed.2) Is this issue a common topic of discussion? The issue of accessibility online is a very common discussion among deaf people. 3) Someone pointed out to me that they are unable to read the text on memes that are posted as pictures since it is in picture form rather than text. Is there a way to bypass this struggle that the person may not know of? 4) Please add any other additional points that I may have forgotten about that I should know about. \n",

      "Help, ideas, options. Sleeping safety smoke detector. Hello community.  1st time posting.  I will try to provide as much details as possible. I am looking for help as well as perspective from the hearing impaired community.  I am hearing, however my step son is completely deaf with bilateral Cochlear implants. He is very much considered a huge success story having no deaf accent (his vernacular) and little compensation.  Of course this is only while wearing his implants, without which he is completely deaf if both ears.   What I want to create this forum post for is specific to our houses deaf challenges in 2 regards.  I searched Reddit and elsewhere but didn't find much that I was looking for.  Forgive me if I've missed something somewhere, buried by all the superfluous information out thier. The first topic is a simple alarm clock.  As a teenager, this kid can sleep. Sleep through anything. And of course since he sleeps without his implants, he is oblivious to any sounds.  We have a shaker alarm. This thing would be great, once he has had time to train himself to detect and wake when it goes off.  Right now thats a pipe dream. We can hear the buzzing from ther rooms, but he doesn't and the vibration presently is insufficient to even stir him. I have found that smoke detectors for the hearing impaired is extremely disappointing.  Specifically integrations. Nearly the bulk of the market is strobe light notification. This wouldn't wake me in an emergency and certainly not a teenage kid like ours. I don't mind having a strobe light, but I do not want to be dependent on only that. So here is my idea. I want to create a alarm clock that will trigger a winch. Piston jack or anything similar thay will gradually lift one side of his bed to a slight angle (45 or less) where he slides gently out of bed or the muscle control to stay in bed, is signal enough to wake up.  For example if the shaker alarm triggered a winch instead of the shaker.  Then I want integration with the smoke alarms. Carbon monoxide alarms. Etc.  Even better is emergency txt notifications on his phone can also signal the bed to raise. So for this post. This thread. How is the deaf community dealing with these intricacies? I'm surprised that more inventive ideas are not more readily available. Or least easily found. Anyone want to help me make a prototype we can sell to the community? Thanks in advance. \n",

      "I need help choosing a new phone for someone with low vision and physical disabilities. My nephew has been using a Samsung Galaxy S4 for a couple years and it works perfect for him. With S-Voice, he can completely operate the phone without pressing a button. It also prompts him about reading out, replying, or ignoring texts. It reads outgoing texts before they are sent, allows changes (important because he has minor speech problems), etc.The S4 was getting a little old so we bought him an S6 Active. Well, Samsung decided to gut S-Voice. It doesn't even read out caller names anymore. Many of the prompts are gone, none to reply, it doesn't verify who he is about to call, etc. On top of all that, it is now very slow to respond and seems to stop listening quickly, only giving a visual cue. Basically, it wasn't working for him.So, I started in on apps. I tried a bunch of hands free apps, most require some sort of visual cue or button press. Dragon Personal Assistant was promising, but it couldn't check texts, not recognizing the messaging app for some reason. It was also a little buggy in reading out names and texts. I tried using multiple apps like a combo of a talking Caller ID apps, Dragon, and S-Voice but they interfered with each other, often causing the ringer not to work and other issues.It was very frustrating. We ended up returning the S6 Active and he is back on the S4, with its cracked screen and overused battery.So, we spent hours using iPhones, Motorolas, HTCs, LGs, etc., trying to find something similar to the old S4, no luck.I am hoping some of you can help me out here. Now, I did try some apps specifically for the blind. They seemed to be centered around a screen reader. Well, that doesn't really work because of his motor coordination problems. There seems to be a lot of required screen interaction and he just isn't there yet. I obviously missed something in my search. Maybe there was a setting on one of the phones that I missed. There has to be an app, screen reader, or a phone out there that allows complete voice control and gives complete voice feedback without requiring screen interaction. I hope somebody here can point me in the right direction. I am open to any phone platform, app, whatever.   \n",

      "Does anyone have any advice for communicating in a noisy environment? I am a university student with mild hearing loss and can't currently afford hearing aids, or even an appointment with an audiologist. I have some issues with my classes, but today there was an incident that really showed me that what I'm dealing with is more than just the issues every hearing person has to deal with in noise. I was with a group of friends at a common meeting area, and there were a few other people there, though it wasn't hugely loud. My friends were able to carry on a normal conversation, but I could not understand a word that was being said except by the person sitting directly across from me. Given that everyone else was quite clearly able to understand what was being said, I mostly just sat out. A bit later it became more crowded and noisier, and at this point I often had difficulty discerning whether or not someone was speaking if I couldn't see their mouth. I had difficulty understanding the person across from me. The level of noise eventually died down enough to the point where I could join in, but I'd already missed most of the conversation by that point.I'm just wondering if anyone knows of anything I can do to try and improve my comprehension in noisy environments. All of my friends that don't think I'm faking hearing loss do not know any ASL, so that isn't an option. I can hear things okay in a quiet room, if I can see the person in question. \n",

      "Help me develop an emergency alert system for the deaf and HOH! Hi! I am working on developing an alert system for the deaf and hard of hearing. The system uses FM radio transmission and the satellite infrastructure set up already through public radio. In an emergency such as an extreme weather event, this system will remain functioning when the power and phone networks are no longer working. We have some prototypes developed. Here’s a video ( We’ve come a long way since then. WE are working and reworking the system every day. Right now, I’m making sure we keep our consumers in mind. We are hoping to use this to reach communities that are vulnerable during emergency events because they do not receive warnings and alerts. These include the deaf and hard of hearing, the elderly, non-English speakers and people for whom English is a second language (this is because, in the course of my research, I have learned that those who are born deaf and communicate primarily in ASL consider English to be their second language). I’m here because I’m hitting a wall and I’d like your input before we go into the next round of consumer testing. My efforts to make this useful for all groups have led me to focus on simplicity. More visuals, less acronyms, reducing visual noise… This presents a problem because alerts from the national weather service are wordy generally awful. We need to balance simplicity with enough information to get the point across and get people to safety. I know you are all comfortable with written English but do you know anyone in the deaf community (or non-native speakers/ESL) who is not? Do you have ideas for getting alerts to them when traditional media isn’t working?How likely would you be to purchase a radio caption display (the alert system) if it were affordable?Do you own devices to partner or plug in with this device? (Bedshakers, strobe lights…)What kind of alerts do you currently receive if any? (tv/radio/internet)Have you had past difficulty in receiving alerts?Have you experienced an emergency about which you had trouble getting information?TLDR: I’m helping develop an alert system for the deaf and hard of hearing to receive national and local alerts. How do I reconcile simplicity and ease of use with getting enough information across clearly?  \n",

      "Audiobooks for the blind I have an older family member who has been slowly losing his sight over the years. Now he is almost totally blind. He used to really enjoy watching TV and movies. So, I've been thinking about getting him some audiobooks that might interest him. However, I'm concerned about a few things...He and his wife (the only other person in the house) are technologically challenged. They do not have a computer or internet access. Also, the method for providing books needs to be simple and ideally something he can initiate and control on his own. Expecting her to control the audiobooks is definitely not a good option. He also lives far away, so my ability to help him in-person is very limited. I could probably supply him with new books every few months or so.Any thoughts on how to possibly pull this off?

      "On Apple TV, does your voiceover have the same navigation sounds as on your iPhone? I’ve been tinkering around with a Settings on my Apple TV a little bit to try to turn off some of the verbosity features and it turned out the thing I wanted to disable the most was actually under the rotor and I had to enable hints to turn those off and then take it back off my rotor. While doing this though, I realized some thing. For whatever reason when swiping left to right, to navigate between items on the screen, voiceover doesn’t have the same sound effect it does on my iPhone. What’s weird though, is on my previous Apple TV, this was the case. And it was like that. What was also strange about my previous Apple TV though, was that when I wanted to navigate up and down on the screen, I would have to swipe over to the vertical navigation and my rotor as well, which doesn’t seem to be the case here. It seems like I have access to pretty much everything Navigation wise like I can just simply swipe up or down or left or right end it would be fine. But the odd thing here, is that if I open up the apps menu on my Apple TV, and I want to close an app, normally I would have hovered over the app and swiped up or down with the actions when you selected on the rotor, and it would allow me to close the app there. But it seems like now that isn’t something I can actually do. do any of you have any idea what might be going on here? I have a feeling maybe it’s some kind of navigation now that I don’t have turned on that needs to be enabled, but I’m not sure. I did change the navigation style and the voiceover settings to follow focus instead of direct touch because I personally don’t find it very intuitive to move my finger around to select the items on the screen I would rather swipe especially on my YouTube app which seems to have a strange delay before it reads me the titles of YouTube videos.

On Facebook, there is an alternative text tool to add to an image that can be read by screen readers. Is it better for people to use the alternative text tool than to add the image description to the status itself? I have been doing both but wanted to know if one was seen as more accessible or better to do than the other. Most people I know add the text only to their statuses and not the alternative text, but none of those people are blind or vision impaired so I'm not sure if that is the best thing to do or not. \n",

      "Setting up virtual Linux OS on my Windows Desktop with a Screen reader Greetings R/blind, I hope whoever is reading this is having a good day. I am currently working through the Odin Project (a Full Stack Web Developer course) and I am in current need of assistance pertaining to accessibility. I am a screen reader user and I use NVDA on my machine on a daily basis.The Odin Project requires Windows users to switch over to Mac or Linux in order to utilize tools such as the command line. I have a Mac but the Voice Over is not the best in terms of functionality with the os and it could get quite buggy. So I figured that my best option is to install a Linux virtual os on my Windows Machine. The Odin Project provides directions for this using VirtualBox and Ubuntu but, after setting up the vm in VirtualBox the rest of the instructions are not screen reader friendly. My question is if any of you are screen reader users and you got Linux set up in a Virtual Machine, how did you do it? What did you do to make things easier? My apologies if I am not being very specific with any terminology as I am very new to Linux. Thanks for your responses and please be respectful.TLDR: I am a screen reader user going through a web developer course called the Odin Project. I am required to set up Linux in a virtual machine on Windows and I am struggling with doing this while only using a screen reader and no sighted assistance. Looking for any suggestions on doing this and perhaps making things easier for myself.PS: I would not mind hearing of any tips and tricks to adjusting with operating on Linux as well!

Two kinda amusing ones I can think of:\\- I keep a glass of water by my bedside. One night when i went to bed, I turned my light off, took out my aids and dropped them on my bedside table. A half second after I dropped them on the table, i felt a splash of water on my hand. It took me two seconds to register what had happened. I grabbed my glass of water and threw it on the carpet. My hearing aids were somehow unscathed.\\- Got into the shower one evening. Took me a solid 5 minutes to work out why the sound of the water was louder than usual. \n",

Her career goal is to be an interpreter, to give an idea of how hard she is working on building her language skills.I myself can only finger-spell with any kind of speed, but I'm constantly working on bettering myself; and while I am far from proficient, I am constantly learning more vocabulary and using it as frequently as possible (sim-com) which I know is bad for the future in terms of grammar, but helps me to remember common words and phrases.  We've also looked into purchasing shake-awakes, doorbell lights, lighted smoke detectors and other such needed items for the future or if we were able to adopt an older deaf child.I suppose what I'm asking is: Do you think that this is a good idea?

Please read this and share your raw and honest opinions on whether or not I should drop out of nursing school.I have a unilateral Cochlear Implant and was raised in the context of oralism. I also do not know any sign language. I really wanted to be a nurse since I was young so I got accepted however when I applied, there was no part where I had to disclose my deafness or a disability. When I got accepted, I revealed my deafness to the program faculty and they were surprised but told me that they are willing to support me.Well, after some hurdles, they have created an accommodation plan for my clinical placement. I also have an interpreter who has actually worked for deaf healthcare professionals so she has been extremely supportive of me. I also have a tutor who again is familiar with working with deaf persons so I have a good team behind me.However after I started my clinical for my first time, I have noticed that I've come across some challenges. Sometimes when I'm giving a partial bath to my patient, I'm not looking an interpreter hence missing out some sounds when I could have used those moments to further build a therapeutic communication with them. But nope I wasn't aware that my patient was talking to ME because 1) I was not looking at the interpreter 2) I'm not used to having an interpreter since I was raised orally.Furthermore, because of this incident, I'm really scared that in my future placements, I may not be able to hear any information from my patients that may be if critical for me. For instance, when I'm looking away from a patient for a quick moment and they say, \"oh I'm having a heart attack now!\" And they drop dead right there just because I did not hear them.These issues are making me doubtful.

      "A bit clueless and not wanting to offend As a precursor to this, I have little to no experience with the deaf community so I'm going into this rather blind.There's a woman I've been interested in for a long time who is deaf and one thing that is a particular hang-up for her is speaking. She strongly dislikes speaking because of the \"accent\" (for lack of a better term) she has. She hates it. I, on the other hand, have always found it extremely attractive and endearing on pretty much anybody.I'm not sure how to talk to her about it in a way that won't be a huge slap in the face. I'm inclined to just come right out and say it (I tend to be pretty blunt and direct about pretty much everything) but I kind of feel like in this instance that might not be the right approach. \n",

      "Infant son diagnosed with unilateral hearing loss - which early intervention program to choose? My 7 week old son has been diagnosed with auditory neuropathy in his left ear only - which has resulted in severe to profound hearing loss in that ear. At present, his right ear appears to function normally and they do not believe there is any risk of the hearing in that ear degrading at this time.At this point, we are faced with two separate paths for early intervention - one that incorporates 'training' his right ear to hear effectively and to compensate for the loss on his left side - another program does this, but also incorporates ASL.We still have a lot of auditory testing to go through - so while this is the diagnosis at this time, there is still a lot we don't know about his hearing. He is too young to undergo certain testing (such as behavioral auditory testing), so we don't know how 'confused' he may get with secondary noises/noisy rooms. The reason I am confused as to what program to choose is this - I/my family have no problem learning ASL, but I went to school with someone who utilized a ASL translator in the classroom, and he always stated that it made him feel like an outsider and isolated. However, I know that there may be times that my son may have difficulty hearing, especially in settings such as noisy classrooms, etc. so it would be helpful to have ASL as a back-up in that situation - but I don't want him to feel like an outsider.If there is someone who can give advice on this - particularly if you also have unilateral hearing loss - that would be very helpful. I know there is not necessarily a 'wrong' choice, but I am still very new to this diagnosis (the initial diagnosis was only about two weeks ago, so while I am ramping up, I have MUCH to learn, and on less than ideal sleep conditions), so if you have any feedback on auditory neuropathy, that would be amazing as well.

      "stressful living situation rant So my wife and I have been together for just a year shy of a decade. We have a 15-year-old from her previous marriage and one 6-year-old together. We have had a good and loving marriage most times but I have always been legally blind and my sight has steadily gotten worse over the years and over the last 2 years I've had one eye removed and the light and perception is fading from the other one so things are getting harder and harder for meMy family is all neural divergent, ADHD autistic and so things tend to be very cluttered and disorganized. We have tried to make steps and are still trying to take steps to keep things more organized and together so that I can function without fear of any accidents and being able to live as independently as possible and not having to ask for help with finding every single thing.And navigable in my home safely or by my side of the bed. And the kitchen table has to be cleared off every time I want to sit down and eat because I'm not comfortable sitting in the living room because things keep getting moved around or cluttered and things. We are trying all very hard but the way I have to live to feel safe and the way they live to feel comfortable our diametrically opposed. My wife says she wants a clean organized house and every time we move we say oh it's going to get better. It's going to be more organized. Everything is going to be in its place and it never is. They're still just piles of laundry or piles of trash or projects. Left undone for small things. Left undone and forgotten and I understand with neural divergence and ADHD this happens but I can't take a step without fear in my own house. And it's been this way for years. Sometimes it'll get better but it's never fixed. It always goes back to the way it was.I love my family and I love my wife but the only place I feel remotely capable or confident is when it work and I dread coming home works already mentally exhausting just to navigate and to function and then it just gets harder when I come home. And yeah I have my family here to help me but I'm tired of having to ask for help for every single thing and feeling so isolated. I love being around my family and my wife but I don't like being in our house. It's exhausting not knowing what trash I'm going to find or what I'm going to trip over next or what. I'm not going to be able to find and have to ask for help for when my wife is already had the kids all day. And I've tried to explain to her we need to prevent fires, not just put them out when they happen. Handle the little things so that they don't keep staying big things. But that's not the way their brains work.We've made changes like I said but it's not getting any easier for me because the light is still fading. My perception is still fading and so it's feels like it's never going to get easier and I'm just going to end up being relegated to my bedside or my little chair the kitchen table for the rest of my life.We have considered the idea of separating and me just having a space of my own like an apartment or something. But I don't want to miss my family. I just want to feel safe and comfortable where I live and that's never happened. It only gets worse every year and these last two years I've had breakdowns and I'm in therapy and we're trying and things have gotten a little better but then they fell right back to the way they were and then I had another meltdown and panic attack and now we're cleaning again all weekend but I know it's not going to stay that way. I'm just at a loss of what to do. \n",

      "LowVisCam - Camera & Image Tagging Application for Low Vision and Blind users I created this accessibility application for school designed for low vision and blind users. It uses facial detection software to provide audio feedback to a visually impaired user to allow them to frame themselves, or others, in the camera frame. Headphones are required for best used of the audio feedback. The audio feedback gives more or less beeps depending on how far left or right you are in frame, and those beeps change in frequency depending on virtual positioning. For example, a face in the lower left corner would give three low pitched beeps in the left headphone, a face in the middle top would give one high pitched beep in both headphones, and a perfect center gives a separate ding sound. Additionally, all design techniques were implemented to work with Android's TalkBack features, hence the frequent amount of toasts displayed.All code is contained in my github, [ There's a video link there so you can see how it works. Any and all feedback is welcome. There's some significant work needed on the app before I feel comfortable releasing it on the Play Store, and with another semester of classes starting up I don't have a lot of time to work on it.

We are a team of researchers at Brown University developing a prosthetic device to assist people who are blind or have low vision.

That said, we believe it could useful for day-to-day tasks.  To focus our efforts, our question is, what daily activities are challenging and perhaps not readily handled with blindness techniques or existing assistive technologies?  Are there tasks or situations that are frustrating or embarrassing that a little visual input could help with? Are there particular objects that you often wish you could locate visually, or difficult tasks that could be made easier with a device like this? A few examples of things our device might do are listed below:Show the user where a door handle or car door handle isLocate text (on signs, posters, et cetera) and read it aloud to the user via an earpieceDetermine the distance of an obstacle in front of the userHelp the user sort laundry into lights and darksHelp the user to locate objects that have been dropped on the floorWe would be extremely grateful for any suggestions or ideas you might have, or any feedback about the functions we are considering.

      "Polylinguists learning Sign Language This is just a personal observation, I wondered if others agree?People who learn sign as a 3rd/4th/5th language tend to sign in a very stiff/precise manner. When I've asked, they have tend to have been interested in signing from a \"love of studying languages.\" It struck me that verbal foreign languages are perhaps more strict with grammatical rules, tables etc. which in BSL (and sign languages in general?) are more fluid. Therefore those interested from a linguistic standpoint may struggle with this- and the lack of a written component- which becomes apparent in their very formal way of signing.Which leads me to an idea that of course signing is a language, but it is perhaps more of an art form, which is something that learners should bear in mind?Please feel free to respond with your own views. \n",

Screens look freaky to me but they do work, and I've been wanting to buy a decent tablet for a while to make the most of my limited vision.My wife says she can buy me one now and I've pretty much decided to buy either an iPad Mini or iPad Air. We're going to the Apple Store tomorrow, and hopefully they will let me play with both for a while to see what works best for me.I'm new to Apple, and also new to being blind. So, lots of questions.I guess the big thing I need to decide first is Mini or Air? I'm rhinking the Air is generally the winner -bigger Lquid Retina display, better processor, speakers and everything else. But is there anything I'm missing?(I will be using this for writing (books, not e-mails), Web stuff and entertainment -audiobooks, the odd movie and hopefully some gaming if I can find accessible games.Vision-wise, I have semi-decent central acuity in about 5 degree field, outside of that is foggy and has numerous dead zones. Very poor color perception and loys of flashy haloes and auras.I try to reduce glare and overall screen time, so I use Talkback to read everything but I do some visual navigation. And I will b using a Bluetooth keyboard a lot of the time.My second question is what should I try and have them set up or me in the store, as a total Apple neophyte and a newly legally blind person? Are there apps that are so critical I should have them up before I leave the store? How accessible are the accessibility controls?I generally despise voice assistants, but should I let Siri into my life? Is she on by default, and can I make her not be?Does Siri ever get into fights with the VoiceOver lady?And finally, what do we think about the Magic keyboard? Overpriced Apple bling, or most best accessory ever? I plan to be doing a lot of typing, but I do already have a serviceable (but not great) Bluetooth keyboard.

      "Considering getting bilaterally implanted instead of just one CI and one HA [x-post - r/Cochlearimplants] In the last several months, I've been going through testing to see if I was a candidate for a cochlear implant. It was confirmed a couple of weeks ago that not only am I a good candidate for one, both of my ears fit the criteria for a cochlear implant and my surgeon is willing to implant both at the same time. I told him at the time that I was only going to get one because my insurance only covered one cochlear implant. However, last week I found out that I now have new insurance that will cover either one or two implants, depending on my candidacy. If I get the paperwork and forms approved through them--I can be implanted bilaterally at the same time. Is there anyone who's gone through that experience? Would it be better to do it one at a time?I only ask because my right ear is essentially \"dead\" with over 100 dB hearing loss and a hearing aid has not been able to help it for 6 or 7 years now. However, my left ear has around 90 dB hearing loss and I can still use my hearing aid with it. On the other hand, my hearing aid is almost 6 years old and showing signs of wear and tear. I'm seriously considering getting bilateral implants... if my insurance will let me go through with it. I'm a bit concerned, though, about losing the residual hearing in my left ear and the possibility of either implant not working.Thoughts? \n",

      "BAHA First off, please let me know if this is the wrong place for this question. I don't have a lot of experience with subreddits related to deafness, so I'm kinda taking a shot in the dark here. Okay, anyway, a little bit of background. When I was thirteen, I started feeling a stabbing pain in my right ear. This lasted maybe one or two days, and then one morning, I woke up completely deaf in that ear. This led to hospital stays, tests, and eventually my becoming a patient of one of the foremost ENT doctors in the country, and yet, despite all that, I have yet to receive a definitive answer as to why I went deaf in one ear.Still, though, I've adjusted pretty well. I overcame my balance issues, I've learned to largely ignore the tinnitus, and most people can't even tell I have hearing issues. However, there're two things I still struggle with. The first is hearing people on my right side, which can be a problem when driving or interacting with others in a group. On more than one occasion, I've had people tell me they thought I was just ignoring them. And on top of that, I've had girls think I'm going in to kiss them when I turn to hear then better. The second is sound localization, which is sometimes an issue when someone calls my name or I hear an ambulance or I'm trying to find my phone while it's ringing. On the surface, it sounds trivial, but anyone with single-sided deafness knows how frustrating these things can be. So my question, then, is does anyone here have any experience with BAHA implants? Does the sound produced seem realistic? Does it help with sound localization? This last concern has produced mixed results when I try to research it, so I've finally decided to look for someone who has actual experience with the device. After all, I'd hate to go through with the surgery, only to find out I'm not better off than I was before. Anyone willing to share some first-hand experience? It'd be greatly, greatly appreciated.  \n",

      "How to best recommend ASL to HOH loved one? Apologies if this is not the right place to ask this! Just trying to find some advice here.My mom is HOH and has been progressively losing more of her hearing for the last 30 years or so. She’s had hearing aids my whole life and as the technology has gotten better/as they could afford better hearing aids, her functionality has stayed about the same even as her hearing has gotten worse.However, even with the hearing aids she has now, which she likes a lot, it’s getting much harder on her in public, group situations, places with a lot of ambient noise, or where she can’t see peoples lips, etc. Not to mention, sometimes when we’re at home, she just doesn’t want to wear hearing aids which renders her nearly deaf, unless you’re standing close by, looking directly at her, and speaking slowly. I spend a lot of time out with my mom and have ended up being her interpreter for the last maybe five years or so, but I worry all the time about her hearing continuing to impact her quality of life especially as she gets older. I really think she could benefit from learning ASL, and I’m sure the family would be on board with learning as well if it’s something she wanted to do. But she’s been very hesitant when I brought it up in the past, I think she views learning it as “giving up” on her hearing. Even things like flashing smoke detectors she’s been resistant to, which I worry about all the time (I’m a worrywart honestly). Any advice on how to help her see she could use ASL as a tool in addition to her hearing aids? Or any insight from other HOH individuals on how you manage interactions in public where it’s hard to hear or without your hearing aids? \n",

      "How do I teach my deaf child to read? D/deaf redditors without *any* hearing - how did you learn? Hi r/deafI'm a hearing parent at my wits' end - I wonder if you can answer this question or point me at any useful resources? My child is 8 with basically a zero reading age. No school has satisfactorily taught him to read and his ToTD have no idea how to go about it. Over the last year even his early alphabet/fingerspelling recognition has slipped. I now realise I'll have to do the job. But the approach to use is problematic.- My son is profoundly deaf and will not wear aids. There is debate as to whether aids would assist him anyway - his ENT surgeon thinks probably not, which is why he won't wear them.- My son therefore has no speech, and no hearing. He has rudimentary sign, and his Mum and I are learning BSL and attempting to add some linguistic and cultural structure to our 'household sign language'. But it's a slow process- we're just working on our BSL L2.- He attends a mainstream school with a deaf/H.I unit. He has his own ToTD (teacher of the deaf). But they've had no success, for reasons below.- In researching how to teach him to read, his schools and I have run into problems because ...-- all approaches seem to rely on the use of sound and/or verbalisation of sounds; be they part-words, onset-midword, or whatever. I cannot find information about how children without *any* access to sound at all are taught to read. For all practical purposes he cannot hear words or intelligible speech so cannot relate reading to sound in any way, especially not to English speech.-- all approaches seem to make the assumption that I want to teach him to read in such a way that he can decode or reproduce the meanings of spoken English. For the reasons above this is not possible and I wonder how children without access to English speech are taught to read. For example, do they learn to read English words for their BSL topic-comment structures, or just key words for necessary concepts? I believe there must be other children without access to speech even with technological aid, and that they must learn to process and use written language in some way. Can you please help me find out more, redditors?**Edit** - thanks everyone for the invaluable input. I'm following up on all the suggestions and especially reading. His current educational placement is actually a recent change and a vast improvement, though still with much to be desired, obviously.For those who are shocked and dismayed about this happening so late: well that's not really any of your beeswax, nor what I asked about. Your views are irrelevant, so why burden us with them? If you must know, the problem has been low priority until now. He had other complex medical issues and keeping him alive was the main struggle for most of his life to this point. Now we have the luxury of worrying about reading, which is great.  \n",

      "4-month old hearing loss... am I crazy? My newborn failed her hearing screening tests while in the hospital twice and was referred to an audiologist, who diagnosed her with bilateral moderate-severe hearing loss. We were then referred to an ENT for follow up, who confirmed the same results. So I've got two ABR and two OAE tests (virtually the same results/numbers) confirming her hearing loss. The ENT believes it's due to genetics (recessive nonsyndromic) and we won't know if her hearing will worsen over time until we speak with the genetic counselor to find out which gene caused it.This is my first and only baby - I feel like I have no reason to deny these results since both tests came out the same and both professionals are telling me the same thing. But I feel like she CAN hear better than what the results show. She responds to my voice (when I talk normal) and seems to always respond to the quietest noises (floorboard creaking, low noise from another room, my husband and I whispering to each other near her). I'm not trying to be in denial - we already have her appt set for hearing aids and a speech pathologist appt, and I'm looking into ASL courses that I can take so I can teach her the language. I just can't help but feel like she can hear better than what the tests are showing .. Am I crazy? If I fit her with the hearing aids, I could impair her hearing if she does in fact have normal hearing but if I don't then I'm risking her speech development being delayed. I feel like I should listen to the experts, seems foolish not to but I just can't shake this feeling that they may be wrong.Any advice? What would y'all do?

      "Quick question on blind people and \"face touching\" Just to note: I understand from some research I've done that the \"face touching\" thing is largely a myth in terms of how it is presented in movies, but that some blind people may do it.I am writing a novel, and one character in it is a very elderly lady who has age-related blindness.A possible plot point hinges on her being able to recognise some physical similarity between a young woman she knew from her sighted days, many decades ago, and that same woman's great-granddaughter whom she doesn't meet until she is blind, so is only able to see through touch.Is the above scenario plausible in any way?The line of dialogue I imagine her saying is something like: *\"I think you must look rather like her\"* - like it's not an exact thing, but a general impression.Thank you very much if you are able to help with this. \n",

No sound/vibrations mean north and they peak when pointing south. *It is recommended to* **use it with headphones or by putting the phone in the sleeve of your shirt** *so that the vibrations are felt more easily.**The app allows for voice recognition by swiping left and then clicking anywhere on the screen.*[You can download it here]( would really appreciate any feedback/recommendation/idea you may have, and I will respond as soon as I can.** \n",

      "Paracentral acute middle macuopathy Hey all,I had a pretty serious episode of acute pancreatitis earlier this year and have since been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. About 2-3 days into my hospital vision, after my pancreatic condition actually improved, I woke up with two huge blind spots in my central and paracentral vision.   I complained to the nurses about this but they didn't seem to concerned, and assumed it was related to my malnutrition, hyponatremia or the pain medicine I was on (I was hallucinating a fair bit). The blind spots did improve after about a week, and a week later I was released from hospital. However going back to my regular life (I use a computer a lot) I realised something wasn't right, a strange haziness, and it wasn't getting any better.One day I decided to cover each of my eyes to see which one was causing the effect. Then I realised that each eye still had a blind spot in the paracentral area. With both eyes open I was able to read (with some strangeness), so it seemed like my brain was piecing together the missing parts from each eye.I eventually went to an ophthalmologist:>OCT scans confirmed some hyper-reflectivity in the inner nuclear and plexiform layers of both eyes. Fundoscopy showed was unremarkable but showed some subtle pale whiter areas in the paracentrla arcades which coincide with hyper-reflectivity on the OCT scans. I discussed these changes with NAME, and the self-limiting nature of this conditionI was diagnosed with paracentral acute middle maculopathy. The doctor told me that it was something to do with my acute pancreatitis but that was about it. I've since researched the condition and learned that ischemia generally causes this. After going through my hospital records (I was having bloodtests daily, sometimes multiple times a day), I noticed that around the time the blind spots first emerged my platelets skyrocketed from low to very high. A bit later on I was injected with anti-coagulants, so my theory is that was the cause. I'm going to ask my doctor about this when I next see him.In the past few weeks I've been noticing my vision changing again. For example: looking at something with a high contrast ratio (the LEDs of a screen against the black plastic frame) I have noticed a were 'smudging' effect. It happens in a slightly striped pattern, where the high:low contrast 'leak' into each other like watercolors. Lights also have a strange 'orb' around them, more than they normally should. My eyes are becoming very sensitive to brightness and rapid changes in contrast. I went to the eye hospital again about this. They gave me another OCT and had me do a field test. Nothing was found, and I was told I have even improved in the left eye for the field test (I feel like this was accidental, because every time the white dot appeared in the test the machine made a sound, and I became sort of conditioned to press the button whenever I heard the sound).So at the moment I'm really lost and confused about all of this. On one had the eye scans are showing no changes, and was told there is a slight change of improvement. But on the other had my vision is subjectively becoming more distracting for every day things. I'm terrified of my vision getting any worse.Does anybody have any advice on how I can look into this further or get more answers (scans, tests, etc)? Does anyonce have any experience with this condition?Thanks! :) \n",

When I asked him about speaking ASL, he said that it was very difficult because he has to translate what he wants to say from Spanish to English, then English to ASL. My question is, if ASL is its own independent language with its own structure and syntax, does he really need to think about what he's going to say in English before he signs it?

      "Recently looked at my old IEP to educate myself on my vision and I have questions. Thing Is I don't understand the numbers and what I identify as. And now I'm confused. I was born with optic atrophy and right exotropia. For my exotropia I got surgery for it in 2013/2014. But here is where I am confused. It says my right eye is 20/400 and my left is 20/200 visual acuity. Does that mean I am in between 20/200 and 20/400? Here's what is written on my IEP this is from my senior yr of high school, and I never looked at until now.Noted distance visual acuity aided OD (right eye): 20/250-1 and OS (left eye): 20/380. Acuity with a 6x monocular telescope: 10/20 (Equivalent \"20/40\") Acuity with an 8x monocular telescope: 10/12. 5+2(Equivalent \"20/25+2\"). Near vision indicates 16 point font is comfortable (this has changed since it was written. I need bigger font now, and Large print books with 18 font or bigger work for me. But 18 still is unfocused unless its up to my face). contrast sensitivity is scored as 1.36 log units (moderate loss of contrast sensitivity). This would suggest that contrast plays a greater role than expected in her ability to see and that contrast enhancement should be a goal. Recommendations: 1.6 x16 monocular telescope, for use with distance spotting and larger field of view. 2.8x20 monocular telescope, for use with distance spotting and stronger power. noted glare bothers her from her computer screen at school. Her most recent eye exam report is from 10-8-2014 states that she has optic atrophy and right exotropia. A previous medical report from DR.  from 10/31/2012, noted her distance visual acuity OD (right eye) 20/400 and OS (left eye) 20/200. Her distance visual acuity of 20/200 means that Fatema needs to be within 20 feetI'm prescribed glasses but over the past few years they have been bothering my eyes. I never wear them at home even when I was a child. I just felt like they weren't necessary and there wasn't much of a difference, but never voiced it to my eye doctor. \n",

      "Request: Input on Senior Project Hello, I am a senior in electrical engineering. My group was wanting create an item to aid the blind with navigation though a room. Our concept is a belt that would be worn on a waist that has vibration motors arranged around it. The belt will vibrate with varying intensities the closer you get to an object. The object position will correlate with the motor that is vibrating on the belt. If you have a table close to you on your left you will feel a strong vibration on your left. if you have a chair far away on your right you will feel a weak vibration on your right. We were also considering extending this idea to allowing a microcomputer to calculate a path through a room to a specified object on the other side. So the belt would essentially guide you through a room of chairs or tables to an object, this would hopefully be able to extend to facial recognizance, allowing navigation to a friend in a cluttered room.I was wondering your thoughts on these ideas, whether they would be useful, or anything to add or take away from it.  \n",

Include her in group conversations - try to avoid having the whole conversation stop and wait for me to \"translate\" to her.3.

Alot of us know that if you tap the home button on the ipad three times Voice-over turns itself off and on. There is a feature within the S 7 and the S 6 that allows for this selection. It's called Accessability Shortcut. I went into the application manager and force stopped Talk-Back. It completely kills the accessability completely, which normally requires someone who can see to turn it back on. When the shortcut is selected its no longer necessary.Second, I discovered that you can do what's called some kind of button reassignment. I haven't done this, but if I'm reading the description correctly, I can reassign the home button for a hold down and then voice search through Google. A form of Syrie.Third, You can set up a back up on pc so that if something completely craps out on the device, a back up like itunes can restore everything. Just as you had it. Hoped this helped some. \n",

      "A case of neurological blindness. First time poster here. Not asking for medical advice. Just other people's opinions or experiences. My wife (25) has had a long journey after going blind about 4 years ago. She sees many amazing specialists to assist her in regaining as much sight back as they can. This was her wish as we believe blindness, as with all disabilities are not something bad, or something that needs to be \"cured\". She has an issue that has stumped her opthamologist, neuro-opthamologist, and neurologist. She has a dark \"block\" in her field of vision. It's centered and a little to the right. She can see it when she closes her eyes. So obviously it's technically in both eyes. The neurologist states it's structurally related and to talk to the opthamologist, whereas they say if you can see it in both eyes, then it's neurological in nature.Has anyone encountered or heard of a neurological vision block? I know her medical history is vast and no one hear knows it, and I can be a little vague. So if there's any further information I can give just let me know. Thank you all. \n",

      "Question about my name sign? Hi everybody!Yesterday, I received my name sign from a Deaf man that I've become quite close to (right now I'm a sign 4 student). At my school, we don't have a very big Deaf community (I believe we have 2-4 Deaf children in our town), but this guy lives about 2 hours away, and he's come to our school a couple of times and him and I have gotten pretty close, so he gave me a sign name!Since he doesn't have any sons, the sign name he gave me is the same as his, except with a different letter (mine is with an R, his is with a J), so I believe that that makes it all the more special.However, there's a guy on our campus (his brother is Deaf), so he's been to Deaf camps, he's met a lot of his brothers Deaf friends, and he's quite immersed in Deaf Culture.After hearing me say that I got a sign name, he said mine didn't count because the guy who gave it to me uses a CI sometimes. He doesn't use it all the time, but he needs it to perform, and he will use it to talk to people after his shows. Other than that, he doesn't wear it.He says that since he has a CI, he's not \"Deaf\" so he should not be allowed to give out sign names. Personally, I disagree. This man is Deaf, he signs, when he does speak (outside of his shows) he uses SIMCOM, and even though he has a CI, he's still Deaf.I just wanted to get some more insight from other people, especially from people that are Deaf, or that are more immersed in Deaf culture than I am (I'm trying).Thank you everybody! \n",

      "Recently Diagnosed With RP -- Any Advice for Blindness-Prepping? Hi, everyone! So....I was recently diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at age 41 (I'm a female). I always suspected I had it after an eye doc mentioned the possibility when I was about 12. The swirling silver fire (as I describe the edges of my visual field) has been creeping down for years. Now I know for sure, and I've discovered that knowing for sure actually sucks a lot more than not. I'm still a sighted person, though the RP is definitely noticeable in my peripheral at this stage. I'm just going to run on the assumption that yes, all I'm going to see is the swirling silver fire at some point, and I've got to learn to deal with it right now to keep myself mentally healthy. I'll probably do the gene testing next year to see what gene I have this on (Crap, I don't even know if that's the terminology for this), but I do know that no one else in my family, at least to my knowledge, has ever been blind.I've started learning the Braille alphabet on a free app, but I've also ordered a Braille instructional book for the sighted that's packaged with a raised dots workbook (because let's be real--the fingers are gonna be the hardest part of it). I've also been playing around with using Speechify (probably not designed for blind people, but I've got to at least start getting my listening skills stronger. Currently, I'm very visual and struggle with zoning out when people talk. No more of that.)Anyone have any other advice or tips? \n",

      "What do you call yourself? There are various names associated with vision loss and I was wondering what you guys call yourselves. I call myself legally blind because I feel that it is the most accurate term to use. I have friends who use the terms \"low vision\" \"visually impaired\" \"partially blind\" or just plain \"blind\". Some of my friends who have vision that is \"better\" than legally blind feel like they can't call themselves blind because they do have some vision left. Personally, I see no problem with it as it's still referring to vision loss. I honestly don't like the term \"visually impaired\" very much. It's easily confused with refractive errors and the phrase itself focuses a little too much on what is broken. To me, visually impaired has more of a negative connotation and \"blind\" is simply more of a denotation. I don't mind when others use it, but I generally abstain from saying it. What do you guys call yourselves and why? Do you have any preference over what term is used to describe your vision? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

      "Is it too early to apply for a guide dog? Hi, I’m really conflicted on when to begin the guide dog application process, I meet the criteria for applying with most organisations, I think, I’m legally blind with uncorrectable vision, meet the daily walking requirements, should be able to pay for its needs, have the space and currently can travel two routes independently- the only thing that is slightly hindering my independence right now is that Im not familiar with using a white cane yet (I’m going to start learning at the end of this month). I know most require applicants to be familiar and confident in using a white cane before proceeding but when thinking about it logistically I’m worried that this going to be a very lengthy process. Originally I was planning to see how I managed with just the cane but with my current vision, which has declined a bit more, I’m starting to think about the fact that a guide dog is still really going to help me with things the cane won’t be able to do and that I still might really struggle even with the cane.  My logic is that, if I get accepted for a guide dog that actual training would start after I was familiar with using the white cane (assuming that the application process would take a few months, I assume this because from my experience when dealing with sight related stuff the wait list is always ridiculous in my area) and thus I would be ready when it came to training with the actual dog. The reason I’m on such a time crunch is because my life is getting very busy and is requiring me to become very independent, after this academic year finishes I only have one more left before university. I think I’d greatly benefit from getting a guide dog before university then rather during or after it, I think I need one before it, navigating crowds, finding things, navigating while suffering from experiencing disorientation due to my chronic migraines, having a dog that knows routes and can try and find solutions to obstructions just won’t be possible with a cane especially in the packed inner city also, this year for university applications, I need to do a lot of work experience in places that I am unfamiliar with but feel so barred because of my trouble getting around and think that a guide dog could help me with that.

So does anyone know perhaps the companies that can provide this kind of service in Canada?My friend should be able to recoup costs through \"what the interpreter should originally have cost\", but it'd be nice to avoid getting screwed by \"long distance charges\" if possible here. Thanks in advance, anyone who notices this in time! \n",

I'm hard of hearing, wear a hearing aid/lipread, and can manage a phone fairly effectively with some assistive tech/reasonable adaptations. **At what point in the job-hunting process would you bring this up, and how?**When I got my current job it was on the table from the start - I got an interview under the Two Ticks system where some companies promise to give interviews to any qualified disabled people who apply. I'm also physically disabled and walk with a cane, so I count under that.But all my job hunting before that was done before I knew I was HoH (long story, I have been HoH since I was a kid, only aware it was a medical thing and not \"just me\" since 20s) so I'm low on experience here.All advice appreciated!Edit: Was pointed out I might have more success if I explain what I'm doing now - at present I have an admin job, I deal with a lot of case files, customer contact by phone and email, and customers in person at court.

Thought I'd come here before I go any further in trying to figure out this issue than I have.I have a Phonak Nadia Q hearing aid that I just got a few months ago, and up until a few days ago, it's been pretty much perfect, and runs as expected.Well, Friday, it started acting up. It behaves properly for the most part, but then it starts to cut in and out for a few seconds, and I'm unable to hear anything for those few seconds. It's random, and it normally takes about a few seconds to come back on. I wasn't sure if it was the battery, so i switched them out but it was still doing it so I left it for a longer period in my dryaid, to hopefully get rid of the excess moisture if any, and it seemed to work for most of the day, buit it just started happening again.Any suggestions on how to resolve this?I do have a spare hearing aid (the previous one before this current one), and I have an implant on the other ear, so if it becomes necessary to send this to my audiologist, I can do that without worry.Thanks in advance! \n",

      "As a d/Deaf/HoH person, what is your relationship with the term 'disability' in ref. to yourself and others? (e.g. blind, wheelchair users) An email from my university's disability support service got me thinking about 'disability', mostly in relation to others often put under that same umbrella regarding physical and sensory capabilities.I've never thought of myself as disabled. Probably because of this, I've never given too much thought to the term by way of it being negative (distinguishes the 'able' and the 'unable' or limited) or positive (a valid label/identity, ~kind of~ like capital-D Deaf). I don't take offence at being called disabled - I just don't identify/agree with it.As someone who is d/Deaf/HoH, I've realised I'm not sure how I think of other people who do not share my particular identity but are part of the larger group often referred to as 'disabled'.Is it odd to think of someone with, for example, sight loss as 'disabled' when I am not? Is it offensive? Do blind people also disagree with doctors who see their need to be ‘fixed’?If I were to need to begin using a wheelchair, am I more likely to see it as a disability in the same way that someone who loses their hearing later on is more likely to consider themselves 'hearing impaired', whereas to me it is completely normal?I think, ultimately, its quite an individual thing. It was only as a teenager that I got online and discovered that the things I’d been told were my own problems, such as not wearing hearing aids by choice is a sign that there is “something wrong”, were actually things others like me agreed on, and started to identify with a group of people. At a time when we are all learning and the way we think about identity is constantly changing, it’s interesting to talk about.I’d love to know what you think! :) \n",

It was locked and another MOD post was put up [here]( where there was some discussion about blocking all steampowered links.  Upon further discussion we have elected not to block links but instead take different action.  The concern is not with the steampowered.com website's accessibility or the accessibility of the game itself but rather with the Steam client.  For those of you who rely 100% on a screen reader, the Steam client is unfortunately completely inaccessible which renders your purchase unusable because you must have the Steam client to download and launch Steam distributed software.  &nbsp;The official policy as of now is that Steam links will be allowed, but Automoderator will be flairing an \"INACCESSIBLE\" warning that may not be removed by the OP of a link to anything Steam related.  There will also be a warning message posted by Automoderator so as to prevent people from wasting money.  &nbsp;If you did purchase the game that was recently linked and can't play it, /u/Drop9Reddit helpfully posted [this step by step guide to getting your money back.]( hope this strikes a happy medium between censoring the whole site and making sure people don't accidentally waste their money on an inaccessible platform unknowingly.

I've been learning ASL for the past few months from lifeprint/bill vicars, and I'm so awestruck by how much physically easier it is to communicate (minus my lack of fluency).I'm grateful for my access to speech therapy, but I have been thinking about how different my life could have been if I'd been exposed to ASL as a child.

      "Concept for Braille Character Display, could I bounce some ideas off you guys? As I understand it, current braille displays work based on lines of text at a time, so that the person reading the display swipes their finger/fingers across the line, then hits a button to scroll to the next line. In my opinion, that's not all that fantastic a use of resources, considering that the reader machine needs to be large and elaborate enough to display a dozen or so characters that move in the physical world, adding to cost, maintenance, and other junk keeping the device out of the hands of more people. So I was wondering, would it be too radical a shift to have a device that can only display one or two characters at a time, and instead of manually scanning lines of texts moving your hands, have the braille change under your fingers with a scroll forward/backward toggle? Explaining this as best I can, the current mockup is similar to a Wii controller or TV remote, where the display is on the bottom under the index finger while the top has a trackpad, allowing the user to scroll through text one character at a time. The concept is similar to some speed reading exercises in the sighted world that are... dubious, claiming that the less you have to look at, the more you absorb, showing only words at a time compared to the paragraphs of information conventional reading offers you.  But the point still stands that the less text you have to display, the less of a display you have to have, and the less mechanical-electrical gymnastics you would have to do. So would this seem like an idea worth pursuing, or have similar experiments come and gone before? EDIT: Further thoughts in my own comment on reading one character at a time, virtual scrolling tech, and me being a doofus. \n",

      "Hey /r/deaf, I'm HOH and this is probably the first time I've tried to engage in the Deaf community. How is everyone? My story - I was born with profound hearing loss in my right ear and legally blind in one eye. I didn't really realize a lot of things I struggled with were related to my hearing loss until I came across an article about being HOH and the issues people like me face. When it comes to whether I have more issues missing sight or missing hearing, it's hard to say which one has impacted my life more. Both impact my life in different ways. Anyway. I've been noticing that my hearing in my good ear is starting to go and want to start learning ASL. My significant other is hearing and is also interested in learning ASL because he knows I struggle with hearing in a lot of situations and that the reality is, I will most likely go totally deaf a lot sooner than my peers. It would just be easier to sign for me in a lot of ways. But, like many HOH people living with a hearing family, I wasn't offered that chance as a child and was expected to learn how to live in a hearing world. I guess in a lot of ways I have the typical HOH experience - having a foot in either side of the hearing and Deaf doorway, not always entirely sure which side to go through, advantages and disadvantages to being partially deaf, dealing with other people's confusion over why I'm perfectly happy being HOH and see no reason to get \"fixed\" - and wanted to actually speak to some Deaf people.

The concept of using both hands for the alphabet is foreign to me since I'm a native ASL user and that uses one hand to convey the alphabet. So my question is, is there some sort of shorthand or \"slang\" where you can convey the alphabet with one hand instead of two, and is it used often at all?Just a random thought that popped in my head while watching the recently posted DeafHood video on this subreddit. \n",

      "Job rant Well today I just got fired from my job before I even started because they thought i wouldn’t be able to do all of the job functions. There is one specific part of the job that I wouldn’t be able to do but I could do literally 80% of the job with no issue. I was hired to be a courtesy clerk for a big chain in the US. Literally most of the job functions include bagging groceries for customers and cleaning spills/taking care of the garbage cans. Also cleaning the bathrooms. Where it got tricky was carts. I wouldn’t really be able to safely grab carts from the parking lot but they new this when hiring me. They knew I had a visual impairment. But then I meet with HR and she says my cane is a safety risk for customers in the store and she was constantly belittling me and questioning if I could even do any part of the job. Bagging groceries is literally the most stereotypical person with a disability job ever but they still didn’t want to give me a chance. I have read numerous articles about blind people bagging groceries for this exact company that I applied to. They literally hire anyone. I’ve seen people with all types of disabilities working there. I hate not having a trendy disability lol! If you’re in a wheelchair or or you have down syndrome, you’re hired but if you can’t see, yeah that’s just awkward and uncomfy. \n",

      "Disability discrimination - how often do you experience discrimination and what steps do you take to protect yourselves from potential discrimination? I don't experience outright discrimination often, perhaps once every 6 months or so. What do I experience is discrimination out of ignorance and laziness - I face it almost everyday. I don't mean \"Oh, I didn't know you're deaf\", I mean like \"Oh sorry, I can't do x because I'm busy, can you ask y to do x for you?\" and \"I know you told me you need x, but I figured it would be better if we use y instead. So, here's y\". Most common are along lines of \"Sorry you experienced [incident], this is not what our customers should expect. Here's some £££ as goodwill gesture\".Railway companies are the worst offender of this, I earn on average of £30 per month from them.After repeatedly experiencing discrimination similar to the above, I've decided to buy myself a voice recorder.

      "So my left hearing aid died on me last week... I don't have money or insurance to fix it.  I'm moving out of state this weekend, I'm hoping Vocational Rehabilitation can look at it and try to fix it for free.My old hearing aids were 9 years old, these ones are 5 years old.  These are my first digital hearing aids as I've had analog ones all my life, unfortunately I believe they were made where you need both to calibrate the sounds because wearing only one has given me FAR LESS hearing than my old ones when they were 5 years old, and I wore only one.How long does it take for VR to fix my hearing aids?  I have moderate-to-severe hearing loss in both ears and at this point, I can't get a job because I can't hear more than 5 feet in front of me in a quiet room, with only this hearing aid (with both I could hear up to 12 to 15 feet in a quiet room).I've been wearing hearing aids all my life, raised orally in mainstream schools, was never exposed to Deaf culture or ASL (was actually told by my mom that the reason I didn't go to a deaf school was because I wasn't deaf enough when I had 50-60 dB hearing loss and had to take ESL along with speech therapy, later I found out that she was wrong, she didn't want to admit that her kid had hearing loss so she raised me \"normal\").So you can kind of understand how important they are to me and how utterly \"helpless and naked\" I feel without my hearing aids.  This past week I had to rely on my husband for anything that involved conversations out in public and in family settings, it was frustrating.  A day after my hearing aid died, I had a fever and was bedridden for three days, I'm still sick but I'm getting better that's why I haven't gone to my audiologist or the VR earlier.Now that I'm moving tomorrow, I figured I'll go to the VR in my new state instead.  Does anyone know how long it takes to get the HAs fixed?  I'd like to get a job to help my husband out as soon as possible (am applying for SSI asap too), and more importantly, while I'm also learning ASL on my own time, I'd also love to not depend on him so much in public anymore.

      "Film for Deaf and people with hearing loss Hello!We are students at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden and are currently working on our bachelor thesis. The topic of the thesis is the exerience of film, by people who are deaf or hard of hearing. We have compiled a survey, containing questions which will be used as a base for our study. If you, who are reading this, would like to participate in the survey we would be very grateful! Link to the survey can be found here: would like to apologize for posting an inquiry on this page, without having spoken to an administrator/moderator. We have spent 1,5 month establishing contact with Swedish companies, associations, organisations and private parties, without a single interview or answered survey. So, we are expanding. Our deadline is at the 10th of May and we are now slightly desperate, as our thesis work still has no foundational study results.Yours sincerely,Jonatan Helgason & Filip Tärnskär \n",

      "How do registers/roll calls work for Deaf/HoH students in a hearing school? Hiya, I was wondering Deaf/HoH students would respond to their name in a register/roll call in a hearing school. My first thought is that the teacher would sit them at the front so not only would they be able to hear the teacher better (assuming the student did not have full hearing loss), but the teacher would be able to see whether the student was there or not when they call their name and then not need a response. However, I figured that a buddy system would work, wherein a student who sat next to the Deaf/HoH student would respond to the Deaf/HoH student's name accordingly. For those who went to a hearing school, how did it work for you? Did you use the same system in every class or did it vary by teacher? Thank you so much! \n",

Suspicions confirmed that I'm going through them way too fast now. I prefer the softer silicone molds because hard molds, while they last longer, give me sores or raw spots. My soft molds used to last me 2-3 years, but lately I have to replace them every year. I just realized I feel like I'm due for new ones (not because they have shrunk I don't think, but because I am having hella humidity / water in the tube / poor function), and it's only been 8 months!!! When I was younger, I never had as much of an issue with humidity. I replaced them when they became hard and started to shrink.

      "More vision problems after COVID? I'm curious if anyone else has experienced anything like this. Background on me: ROP, monocular vision, significant retina damage in the one working eye due to the ROP, leading to a very narrow visual field. I have an IOL in that eye and my visual acuity is around 20/100. I also have nystagmus and a past history of narrow-angle glaucoma, but that was surgically addressed years ago.I had COVID back at the end of January. It was pretty miserable, but not anything that required serious medical attention (just a solid week of sleeping). Since then, though, I've had new vision issues that are vague and annoying. Nothing has noticeably changed that my various eye specialists can detect, but my photophobia is a lot worse and it's like I don't have the stamina to use my vision like I used to. Sometimes things get blurry, but for the most part, it's not like my visual acuity has changed. I just can't visually focus on things for more than a few seconds to a couple minutes at a time anymore without the eye strain being so bad I have to retreat to total darkness for a while to recover.My pressure's good, no change in my retina, no inflammation anywhere (anterior chamber, optic nerve, etc. all good), cornea is fine.But this is awful.It doesn't help that my body's physical response to eye strain isn't a headache or anything like that... no, that'd be too easy. It's sudden, severe nausea.At this point, I've purchased a sleep mask to wear most of the time because it's 100x more comfortable to function without my vision than with it. \n",

      "They can't find my gene! I was born with bilateral sensineural severe to profound loss. No other hearing loss in my family tree. Five years ago before we had kids my hearing wife and I had genetic testing, not that it was going to change our decision but more so out of curiosity and so we could be prepared. They tested about 40 genes including all the usual suspects (Connexion 26 etc). Nothing, so they gave us a less than 5% chance of passing my deafness on.Fast forward to now and we have a beautiful pigeon pair. Our daughter is hearing and our son has exactly the same hearing loss as mine.The genetics agency felt a bit embarrassed by their 5% figure and offered to do another test as more genes are being found all the time. This time to ensure they had the maximum coverage they sent the sample to a lab in the USA and 140 genes were tested. Again, nothing. Based on this result I suppose I have a one off mutation in an unknown gene. The lab suggested we come back in a couple of years (presumably to test more newly discovered genes).  Coming from a science/engineering background I'm fascinated by what all this might lead to. For example I have some other small symptoms (such as no sense of smell) that collectively could indicate a new Syndrome of sorts. My daughter can definitely smell but my son is not old enough yet for us to test this with him.So my question is, has anyone else encountered this situation? Are you in the \"unknown\" bucket of medical science? Are you curious about finding the gene(s) in your particular case? Or do you just don't care?I'd love to hear your stories. \n",

      "Just a few questions? Like many individuals that with various conditions, I am sure that the blind community has many tricks to living life with their condition.  So I am here to get whatever input I can from the blind community or others that may hold such knowledge.  Let's go ahead and get the most cliche question out of the way.  As a blind individual, how do you know that you are done wiping in the bathroom?  I know it is a cliche question and some may be tired of hearing it or find it to be in poor taste, but I am asking out of honest curiosity.  Many sighted people go solely by the wipe until the toilet paper comes back white (with nothing else on it).  So why, as a blind individual, does one know that they are truly done?  Also, while many things have braille on the, a specific location, or a unique shape, how do blind individuals distinguish between similar objects when shopping?  Do you simply ask for a store employee to assist you, do you typically bring a sighted friend/relative with you, or use some other method?  Also, how do you distinguish between similar items when they are ate home?  Finally, if you have any other life tricks that you use, please post them.*This post is not meant to be demeaning or derogatory.  I am asking these questions out of honest curiosity.* \n",

      "Deafness and suicide? Hi,i'm 23 and born profoundly deaf, throughout my life I've found it quite challenging coming to terms with my hearing loss. I like to keep positive and channel a lot of these feelings of isolation, rejection and frustration at bay playing the piano and drawing. Though recently I've thought about the option of suicide because I just can't stand trying to be strong all the time dealing with the daily ordeals of living with deafness. More now as an adult than as a child because I can clearly see how much my deafness limits me and cuts me off from a lot of social interaction.I decided to travel by myself away from home till August 2015. So far it's been nearly two months though I still find it hard at times dealing with by myself . I'll give some examples:- Daily I have to repeat my sentences to a lot of people and each time I have to repeat it I feel smitten and annoyed with myself that I mustn't of said it loud enough. A lot of the time too I have to listen to people though sometimes I just don't hear them well enough and this would be where i usually used to rely on others to help me. Though when I look at other people being here they give a really helpless blank look in their eyes. I then ask the person serving food if they were taking to me and they said yes. It still feels foolish of me that I just can't hear so well all the time.Other times I just feel really under confident with myself I can't express  or talk to people like other people who can hear do.I felt like I was with friends with some people back home who never really appreciated with me,  though the more they pushed me away at the time  (i.e - not replying, giving short responses) I still chased after them because I wanted to be accepted by others. Being hard of hearing i feel stuck between both the hearing world and the deaf world. Though I feel like I don't solely belong to either side too. I've learnt how damaging that can be for you to keep running after others who clearly don't want much to do with you. Are they really worth your time? nope.That said, I've learn't a lot about myself travelling alone than what I would've done back home. I used to be easily persuaded by other people or found it hard to say no though living here i've had to rely completely on myself to keep myself safe. I feel really out of my comfort zone though have learnt nobody can really help you if you don't help yourself or appreciate yourself.Also I've learnt being alone isn't bad though it's different from feeling excluded or alone in group/social interaction. You meet people all the time. I found some great strategies to start conversations with people such as playing a piano in cafes and public spaces, usually someone always talks to you afterwards. Even if it is short - it helps me feel less by myself and included.Even though amongst all of this I'm having some good days and really hard days. Though I'm concerned I'm by myself and I'm still thinking suicide is an option to take. With being socially isolated a lot I don't actually think a lot of myself though think maybe that's something i need to come to terms with myself. With no one to really talk to and my reason for it I wondered if other people could relate to this? It might be more i'm sick of having to deal with situations like above at the moment rather than I want to end my life.  \n",

      "experience with ski guides? I haven’t dealt with many formal adaptive ski programs besides in small quantities because I grew up in a household that basically skied every weekend in the winter. My dad guided me from a young age, and when I got older my sister learned, and a couple of other friends did it a little. One of our ski friends got good enough at it to guide quite a bit actually. I was curious how good of an experience people have had with programs for disabled people? I’ve talked to a few people who have been guided into people or trees or signs way more than I’d expect, and I’m trying to sus out whether the default is bad guides, or if I just have more evidence of bad guides from a specific resort or couple of resorts. My dad is (not joking) probably in the top half a percent of guides for blind people in the world. He can guide me through tight enough trees that I can reach out and touch them on either side (usually at slow speeds and not for long stretches) and we regularly ski the steepest of the steep, and very large moguls. I dabbled in racing for a little bit but absolutely hated it with a firey passion beyond anything i’ve ever done in my life before. I know race guides are really good, but racing is not like the technical skiing I prefer, it's . It's just back and forth over and over again down perfectly groomed slopes. I have little interest in skiing groomed runs that are blue or under, I really have more of a passion for technical mogul and shoot skiing rather than just groomed speed stuff. I would rather teach new guides on steep or at least blue-black groomers, because the amount of beginners to hit is lower because people on those runs typically are more aware of there surroundings. I am happy teaching new guides, but I feel like teaching on more intermediate to intermediate-advanced runs is easier because I already can tell about how fast I’m going and can decide to go sloer or stop on a dime.    finding people like that can be difficult. I had an experience with a program recently that was stunned to see a blind person skiing as hard as I \", and couldn't believe I was skiing blue runs, stuff I can ski in my sleep. I was curious if this is just what a lot of these programs expect, blind people who have never skied before, and should I just expect to have to train my own guides if I want anything more than childsplay? \n",

He is picked up before my student and myself, and spends 90+ minutes in the car each direction. He does pretty well, but it's obvious that he's bored and frustrated bring in the car so long.**The Question**: What can I do or bring to help him be entertained for so long? He has some books, but they don't seem to his his attention. I have a work issued iPad that can be used for apps/games (free would be best), or downloaded movies and shows. Any other ideas you have would be great!Addendum: he's in the back with the other student, and I'm up front, so ideas need to be fairly self-contained as I won't be able to interact very much. \n",

A friend passed away by suicide for personal reasons and everyone held a party in remembrance of her. I think it's how she would've wanted us to remember her as, everyone enjoying themselves.At the party I shared a £20 batch of MDMA between 2 friends. We were cautious of it because none of us had tried it. It comes in a white powder form and doesn't really taste of anything. I didn't think anything was going to happen. But then it did kick in.Usually when i'm socialising with people I'm really anxious and self conscious about myself and how I come across and talk to people having hearing loss. Though while i was experiencing MDMA all this anxiety and self consciousness disappeared temporarily. Talking to people became really natural throughout the experience. I know it was only temporary though it felt like a real relief at the time. I didn't experience a come down nor had I taken it since.I felt it made me think more, like why should I be so self-concious or anxious with myself or what others might think about me whenever i get anxious or self conscious talking to people.

      "How do you cope? It's taken me years to work up to the point where I actually want to ask for help. I was diagnosed with hearing loss - sensorineural - when I was a child, I didn't notice it at the time and didn't think I needed hearing aids. My family are immigrants so the last thing I wanted in secondary school was to stand out. Then gradually it got a bit worse but I was still hideously self-conscious about it so I got ITC hearing aids which are barely noticeable.   In the last couple of months I've noticed it getting quite a bit worse; I have a feeling it's something to do with the noise-reducing earphones I got with my new phone and I've stopped using them now. But it's got to the point where I'm really struggling without my hearing aids in shops and social gatherings with several people and background noise. I can barely make out what someone is saying without lip-reading. Conversation in cars is pretty much impossible. I think it's affecting my speech too.  I've always found it so difficult to come to terms with the fact I'm losing my hearing, I've basically been in denial over it. I hate the fact that I'm not \"normal\" (and that isn't meant as a negative comment towards the deaf culture, it's just how I feel) and basically feel depressed and like I'm running out of time to live a normal life.   I suppose my question is, how do you cope with knowing you're slowly losing your hearing? How do you get your self-esteem back? I always feel so awful asking people to repeat themselves that I've pretty much just given up on being social and become withdrawn. I don't want this. And is there really nothing that medically can be done?

However, the college I am attending now has a significant Deaf population and I was just wondering what I can do to be accommodating of people. Is writing on paper okay? Would using cued speech be acceptable or would that be rude / presumptuous? (I know how to cue because of my own auditory processing issues) I just want to be as non-assholish as possible!

      "To all the blind, how can I help you!?! Hello all, I am a senior Electrical Engineering student at UC Santa Cruz and I want some ideas for a project of mine that will better the life of the blind. Let me fill you in.My team and I are developing a set of noise cancelling headphones. These however are not plain, noise cancelling headphones. The headset is outfitted with an array of sensors to monitor the users surroundings. For example, we can map the users physical surroundings such as walls, cars and trees. We can also detect specific sound signatures that occur in the surrounding environment.So, today we were having a meeting and we realized that perhaps the blind could benefit in some way from this project. We unfortunately don't know anyone who is blind. What better forum than Reddit?If you know someone who is blind, PLEASE, tell them about this project. Tell us what they think. Let us know what they wish they could sense or be aware of. If you have any questions please let me know. Thanks!!!!-Andrew \n",

I understand that some popular asl music videos were made by hearing people and the reason why the deaf community isn't happy about it (hearing people getting all the attention and praised, cultural appropriation, etc.)  But sometimes at a certain point, the reactions from the deaf community are a bit too excessive. Some deaf people would even make them *apologize* for creating asl videos in the first place. And...that aggravates me. I personally enjoy watching these videos on youtube. Hell, some of them are really good too. Most of them are doing it for fun anyway? It's like a non-native speaker singing in another language. Why is it *so* offensive?

      "What Is It Like to \"See\" As You? Forgive me if this is considered an offensive or cliched question, and I realize this is probably only applicable to those of you who had vision at some point in your life that you can recall, since you have a framework to describe it by. To those of you who can answer this question, I'm very curious about what it's like to see as *you*. What's your visual field like? What do you perceive?For me, I was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa in early December. (No gene testing yet, so I don't know what type.) What alerted me that something wasn't right was the fact that I hit my head on open cabinet doors a lot and that I'm often startled by people entering my visual field from the side when I'm looking straight ahead. I don't have any issues with color or dimming (yet), and I wouldn't have noticed anything off with my night vision if no one had told me that I'm \"supposed to.\" I'm still not entirely sure my night vision is all that bad.What I perceive on most days is a perfectly good, \"normal\" (in quotes) field of vision with a ring all around the periphery. This ring appears to be a single line of fire moving constantly outward. In the upper field, there are nearly always a few \"patches.\" These patches remind me of the scintillating scotoma I get before a migraine, but they don't obstruct or distort images. They're just annoying if I focus on them.When my heart rate rises, I get a 'fireball' that travels clockwise in a circle around my periphery, starting in the upper left corner and working its way back there. Sometimes the fireball grows more fireballs, and whoo hoo, lots of fireballs for a few minutes.On bad days, I'm more aware of a shadow creeping down in my upper right periphery. It's like having a strand of hair hanging partly over one eye. On those bad days, one eye is usually affected more by visual snow. Everything appears oddly glassy and a tad blurry. That might be astigmatism; I don't know for sure.I read something very impactful the other day. It was just a single very simple line, but it really hit me.  The gist of it was that vision is an extremely personal thing. What each person sees out of their eyes, the image quality, the peripheral range, etc., is unique to them. That got me wondering about everyone out there with low vision, and that's what inspired this question. \n",

Some of you will probably know exactly where this episode is going if I say one word: \"Uber\".But this one has a dog in it. I live very close to where I work, but unfortunately there is a highway between home and work. My wife drives me in the morning, and I can usually hitch a ride home with a coworker going on their lunch break. But once or twice a week, I need to Uber home. Also, I bring my dog to work every day. I work in an animal hospital and it's where he was born, so he has literally come to work with me every day of his life. He loves to hang out with the other hospital dogs and is absolutely miserable when I don't go to work. My dude is a little fluffy white terrier mix who loves everyone but tends to growl at people and then jump up on them for kisses.I call an Uber Pet, it's a BMW SUV. I can't read license plates, but I can recognize cars, at least well enough to know a BMW SUV.Uber says they're here just as a BMW SUV pulls up. I scoop my dude up and go, \"are you my Uber?\" I can't really see if the dude nods, but duh! So I step up.I open the door.I start to get in, holding my dog in my arms.A woman in the back seat SCREAMS.I am out of there.\"I am SO sorry, I thought you were my Uber. I'm blind. I am so, so sorry.\"And I close the door and walk away to find another BMW SUV partked ten feet away, and the driver is calling me to ask if I'm me.

Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, I just thought yall might have some advice for me. For most of the past twenty two years I have grown up with a mother who could hear normally. From what I can tell she's rather young to be losing her hearing due to age (50), but it's happening none the less. The past few months have been filled with lots of passive aggressive \"Nevermind....\"s and sighing. I don't want to sound insulting, because I know some of you can't hear at all, but basically her issue is that she has somewhat bad hearing along with processing issues. The past few months we have basically had to start repeating the majority of things that we say a minimum of three times. A lot of times after the second or third \"What?\" the person talking to her (sadly myself included) gets frustrated and says \"Nevermind...\". I can tell it is frustrating her. She has hearing aids, I don't know when the last time she got new ones was though. Do they make different strengths like glasses? Might she need stronger ones? Other than not being a bunch of intolerant jerks over something she has no control over, are there any other things we as a family can do to help her out? Maybe something like always speak face to face when talking to her? This is still a relatively new issue, so I know we are still adjusting to managing it.

      "Do you find it harder to say 'No' to people being hard of hearing/deaf? Hi r/deaf. Some background:- I was born profoundly deaf, currently 23 and male. Last night I was at a music club by myself. I had a nice evening until this person asked me If I would get him a drink. I played it off 'Ha, sorry I just spent it on a drink for me' walking away from him. Though as the night went on I bumped into him again. 'Go and get me a drink, I've got none' he said pointing his hands at the bar. I wanted to say no  and politely decline though nothing came out, although my instincts was telling me to get away from this person. I walked past a few people first to make it looks like I was going to get a drink though walked to the area next to it to keep my distance.Finally at the end of the night I had to collect my coat though he was still there. He insisted again 'To get me a drink, I've got nothing'. I wanted to say no though because the music was quite loud in the club and I was by myself I found it really hard to say no.He told the guy behind the counter to get a drink, the staff told me that was £10. Usually by the point I would've caved in and done whatever someone had told me to do. In this instance though I told him I didn't have any money. The staff told me to get out and the guy who had been trying to pressure me stood there laughing at me. He was a lot older than me too, some gentleman he is. I didn't mind, it was late and was pleased I was able to not get completely pressured into getting my money out.I actually didn't mind him asking, it was more on the second and third instance I felt pressured and he didn't give me the option to also say no.Till recently I've always found it hard to stick up for myself. Being hard of hearing, you can't hear others so well so you have to guess a lot. A lot people looked confused at you and don't know what to say. I can see how people could see that as an excuse to take advantage of someone or manipulate them. Though this has happened on numerous occasions in the past.Does anyone else find it hard to speak up for themselves or say no if people pressure you into doing things ? I find it really hard to do even today. I wonder if it had any connection to also do with a result of being born HoH.Tl;Dr - Person asked me to get a drink, though I found it hard to say no. Do other people experience this? \n",

      "Advice. My first 3 days impressions on the Samsung Galaxy S 7 as a fully blind user. So, so far in my smartphone life I have owned every Galaxy S model but not including the edge models. I don't play favorites, I also own a Ipad Mini 4, a Samsung tab 4, a windows 7 and 10 pc, as well a mac. My inlaws own iphones, so I have played with 3 models of those as well.Ok, so first day impressions. These are the worst usually because it takes some time to find the system settings that have been rearranged, shifted, or moved. There was only a single point of contention with this. Samsung removed the 'contacts' off of the single bottom row. I thought from now on I was going to have to go into the apps and find it there, or in the 'phone' app, and select 'contacts' from there. It was in the app drawer, once found I re-added it to that bottom row, problem solved.Now for the point of contention that drives most I-phone fans nuts. Google Talk Back...It's no longer pre-installed within the device. Instead Samsung opted to go with their own, which is called 'Voice Assistant'. It has a beta feel to it. The automated back/recents buttons next to the physical home button has to be double pressed, as most options have to be to activate. Once more this is an easy fix if you prefer. Download Google Talk Back from the playstore and go into accessability settings and turn it on.There was a problem. There is actually a repeat problem. New operating systems downloaded to a device, if you're updating the S 6 for example, well it seems to lose any kind of text to speech support for a large number of chrome-based games. Games that use a server to play, but the user interface is downloaded to the device. This problem also, somehow, also makes it so that some of the buttons within games can't be pressed. This solution requires Google to update the Android System web view app. After a google playstore update or 2 it seems to iron itself out. Time is the solution for this. Overall the phone is very fast. On wi-fi apps load instantly. Out on cell data its a slighter lag, but only hardcore gamers are going to notice it. I would say the screen is a little more sensitive then I'd prefer. It makes swiping from left/right vice-versa slightly more aggrivating. There's also a slight lag with pressing the power button to get the screen to turn off. If its not a lag with the screen cutting off, then it lags in announcing it aloud. Ther is one feature then seems a little new. You can setup accessability presets. That way if someone wants to pick up the phone and use it, you can draw in a square on the screen, or any shape you prefer if I heard the directions correctly, and accessability turns off and on from the gestgure. I, myself, would prefer the double tap home button for talk-back/voice assistant to turn on like I-devices use, this exists on the power button for a double tap it blacks out the screen, but it's a nice add.Overall  the phone was a great upgrade for me. Easy for me to use and very fast. The storage expands with a micro sd card, and its water resistant up to 3 feet for 30 minutes. Battery life was very nice for me, twitter, facebook, messenger, messages, what's up, reddit is fun, twitch, tune-in, i-heart radio, and digitally imported radio all seem to run without any noticable lag.I hope my review was informative for you guys. -Roman out. \n",

      "My overall view on eugenics So I wanted to point out a few things concerning eugenics, especially their flaws.It is a concept borne out of nonextant values that were once important in hunter-gatherer societies when humans were still functioning very much like animals. I.e.; foraging to survive, procreating, etc. Even activities like rituals and such are compared to how animals socialize. At that point, there weren't sufficient technological advances that could elevate humans above this state of being. That being said, the modern desire to return to these \"values\" is born out of not necessarily ignorance, but a loathing of these technological advancements. It seems as if these people truly want to remain simple-minded. What that tells me, is that the majority of these people lack the intellectual capability to see past a simple life, and they're bitter because of it. They fear being surrounded by people that think better than they do, and wouldn't it be fair to say that they can be considered disabled because of that? Intellectually disabled.Take Hitler for example. The Nazis carried out Aktion T4 where they genocided individuals with disabilities, including deaf people. Let's look at Hitler. Many people don't know this, but he a few disabilities of his own that were pretty serious. A micro-penis that didn't have the urthera opening in the right place on the top of the glans - it was way down at the base of the shaft. He also had one testicle missing. [Source 1]( [Source 2]( why did Hitler overlook his own disability and execute other disabled people?There is something else as well. There was a genetic test done on hair samples taken from a hairbrush at Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat which is suspected to have belonged to his long-time girlfriend Eva Braun, who he ended up marrying shortly before committing suicide. The genetic test showed that the hair samples belonged to a female with [Jewish ancestry]( There is no evidence that the hair belonged to Eva Braun, though - but the question is: why would Hitler knowingly invite a Jewish person into his home, let alone the infamous Eagle's Nest? This was a place where only high-ranking Nazis and close friends were allowed to converge. If indeed it was Eva Braun's hair, then Hitler ended up marrying a Jewish woman!The conclusion I have come to regarding this, particularly the revival of eugenics in modern day, is that it is a fear of humans developing better technology. These eugenicists *want* humans to remain in the tribal mindset. It isn't difficult to disagree, if you lurk in alt-right areas of the internet and spot the occasional jest: \"reject modernity, return to monke.\" \n",

      "Looking for software for vision impaired people. Hello! My best friends mother is very visually impaired (The state considers her legally blind), and has to use special tools in able to use the computer. She used to use the Jaws software to be able to read what was on the screen, as it magnifies what her cursor is pointing at.Well the software stopped working one day, and Jaws doesn't support that specific version anymore. They said shed have to upgrade to a new version which would cost her $300+ that she can not afford. So I'm here asking if there are any cheaper (Hopefully free) alternatives to this software?

      "Should blind characters be played by blind actors? I am taking a film class about disability and this question has come up a lot. Many sighted actors have played blind people (both real and imagined) in film. Some movies to consider: Ray 2004: Jamie Foxx portrayed musician Ray Charles. Ray was still alive at the time of the film’s production and read the script, offering a few changes. Foxx briefly spoke with him before filming. The film focused more on Ray’s career and less on his blindness. In the film, as in real life, Ray is not shown using a cane, dog, or sighted guide to move about. On an episode of the Be My Eyes podcast, some quipped that Ray would often use his blindness as a defense during arguments, saying things like “I’m in the dark here!” Personally, I wished there were other blind people in the film. Margarita with a Straw 2014: Sayani Gupta played a blind woman named Khanum who falls in love with the main character Laila, a girl with cerebral palsy. Gupta attended classes at NFB and consulted with a blind actor, learning trailing techniques and doing activities blindfolded. There really wasn’t much to her character in the film. In The Dark: TV show where Perry Mattfeld played a blind sleuth investigating her friend’s murder. The show sought out blind actors for the role but it ultimately went to Mattfeld. She learned how to use a cane and wore a blindfold for a week doing cane travel. A film with a blind actor in the lead role: See For Me. In this film, Skyler Davenport played blind former skier Sophie, who must rely on a smartphone app when her house is broken into by intruders. I am biased for this movie because I absolutely love thrillers. Davenport brings a unique complexity to the role. I like what they said in a Forbes interview about disability in film: “It’s not that you can’t be a good actor, and you can’t portray it accurately. But I think people that come into this world, and for whatever reason, their beingness has decided to experience a disability…there’s something so special about that.”What are your thoughts on this? I know that blindness in particular is a very small piece of the pie represented in film. What are the implications of sighted actors taking on blind characters? \n",

      "The sun is my worst enemy (this is a rant, remember that you are in no way obligated to listen to my sad ramblings)  So I have Oculocutaneous albinism and it makes my eyes sensitive to light, I used to think my light sensitivity imposed a few inconveniences but it is kinda making me miserable. The bane of my existence right now is a ball of gas. It’s winter so I can’t help but wonder how odd I look to strangers who pass me by because it looks like I’m wearing sunglasses while it’s 9 degrees Celsius and partly cloudy outside, the worst part is that sometimes even with my photochromic glasses it’s still too sunny so I  have to put my hand over my head. I used to be able to see a bit in the sun but these days my eyes just close on impulse even with shades so walking to school in the morning it’s kinda like performing a stunt. I’m going to get mobility training on how to use a white cane in the future so hopefully this will soon pass, this lady told me there’s a lot of people who need it more so it might be a while. I’m so scared at the prospect of growing up. Like my school is hosting this trip to visit this university and it’s literally in the city that I live in but I decided that I didn’t want to go because none of my close friends were going because I cannot travel unless I can hold the hand of someone that I trust in train stations and places where there’s stairs. I’m so scared of stairs, a determining factor in weather I think a university could potentially be good for me lies within the amount of stairs they have. I keep telling myself once I get a white cane that all these troubles will subside but like what if they don‘t, a cane will mean that I probably won’t have to look down while walking all the time but it’s not gonna help me find my way around a train station and I know that the average person in my situation is taught to memorise routes but I am a lot stupider and anxiety ridden than the average person. I didn‘t trust my self to walk the ten minute walk to school on my own after a year of going with my friends but for uni I’m own my own. Also my short term memory span consists of three digits and my long term is actually worse so there’s no way I’m remembering a journey route that involves taking trains. Speaking of trains, they make me feel way too disoriented.On the topic of experiencing disorientation it’s so frustrating because I can’t get people to understand how it is related to vision, to them when they think ‘visually impaired’ they think person who can’t read without glasses. And fatigue, last week I put my head down with the intention of just resting my eyes without closing them but ended up falling asleep for the entire hour, I got in trouble as well and I didn’t even know what to say I was just so embarrassed. \n",

The first time, I went out to a bar near my house alone, was having drinks on the patio and talking to other people around the fire. This couple I was talking with most of the night asks me to take a picture with them as they leave. I thought it was odd, and given that we didn't exchange contact information, kind of assume it was to post on social media. Likely in the sense of, oh look at this blind guy we met at the bar, we're soooooo cool for talking to him. The second one just happened. I was at a concert/party with my girlfriend, and at some point a random guy comes up and asks if he can take a photo with me. I said sure, because I kind of think it's hilarious, but I still think it's really weird. It really seems like I'm almost being treated like a side show, but I also think it's important for people to see blind people doing normal things. Has anyone else had experiences like this? Do you all find it as weird as I do? For the record, I don't resemble any celebrities, and this has only ever happened with my cane out. \n",

I have always struggled with educational institutions because teachers just are not trained to deal with disabled kids. I went to a mainstream school and college.My current degree (the special ed one) started in august. I told all my professors and teachers that i am deaf and that i lip read and use hearing aids. I communicated my needs very clearly multiple times. Fast forward to 1st november, we were being taught using a powerpoint presentation, AND THE TEACHER SWITCHED THE LIGHTS OFF. Like am i supposed to buy night vision glasses to lipread now? And get this, the irony is, we were being taught about 'HOW TO TEACH DEAF KIDS'. Like excuse me sir, there is a deaf kid sitting in your class right now who isn't understanding shit because you switched the fucking lights off!!I dont think anyone except deaf people can understand the gravity of this situation and how ableist this was and how utterly inaccessible that classroom was for me. I didn't speak up that day because i had spoken up multiple times since the course started in august and i didn't have even an ounce of energy to speak up again. And this incident triggered something in me that i didnt even know existed. Ugh i am just gonna use my instagram account to raise awareness about this because raging isnt helping anyone.

      "Let's Solve Reddit's CAPTCHA Problem There's been a couple of posts recently about the lack of blind users on Reddit and also the current CAPTCHA situation, and I think it's time we do something about it.As background, Reddit uses a CAPTCHA system in many places to guard against automated submissions, robots, and spammers. These are the visual pictures where you need to type the letters you see to complete a task. On Reddit, this is used on the registration page as well as randomly for new posts.As a blind person, these CCAPTCHA systems are virtually unusable. Many sites that use CAPTCHAs offer an audio alternative which solves this problem for most. Ideally, there would be a text-based CAPTCHA as well so that deaf-blind individuals would be able to sign up as well. But currently, Reddit offers no alternatives, and this is likely one of the main reasons that few blind people are on this sub.Implementing an alternative to CAPTCHA should be a relatively simple thing to do from a programming perspective. The trick is to convince the right people in charge that it's something that needs to be done.While the Reddit site itself is not perfect, I find it pretty much usable, aside from the CAPTCHA. There are some tools that can be used to read CAPTCHA words that work in limited situations, but it is far from an ideal solution. The change needs to come from Reddit itself so that this site is usable by as many people as possible.Please cross-post or share this where you feel it appropriate, and let's discuss what we might do to orchestrate change. \n",

      "I have had SSD since 2011 and I am now really looking into getting a BAHA, as it is my only option... I've been putting off the idea of having the device implanted ever since my Radical Mastoidectiomy back in 2011. (It's a screw, IN.MY.SKULL. WTF?!) Now that I'm starting different jobs that require customer service I'm starting to realize how disorienting crowds can really be. From the beginning I never wanted to use my slight deafness as a crutch. It took failing a few classes in college and almost getting hit by a car to realize I may need some help. However, my only useful help is the BAHA.  My main reason for this post, I guess, is to ask for some advice on how people have coped with their unilateral hearing loss. Or how their BAHA process worked (healing, experiences, insurance/pricing?) I'm sorry if this post was ranting and/or long. First posting and whatnot.  \n",

      "Learning Tactile Sign Hello everyone. How do I learn tactile sign language? Are there classes in this? Due to a brain disease, I am a vision impaired person of hearing, and I want to learn to communicate with deaf people. I had a seizure a few weeks ago and it was a deaf woman who raised the alarm. I wrote her a few notes in big letters thanking her, but there are days when I can't even read large print. So I thought to myself, I should learn tactile sign language for deaf-blind people! There many people out there who are deaf or speech disabled (including 2 people close to me) and I want to talk to them. Would most sighted deaf people be able to understand tactile sign from a blind person of hearing? Can you help me, r/deaf? \n",

      "Communicating long distance with my deaf grandmother. I apologize for this post being so long. I think it is necessary to understand the whole situation.I love my grandmother dearly. I lived in her house my first years of college instead of with either of my parents (they are divorced). Communication was never too difficult, because I was a short car ride away.My grandmother (who I call granny) has always been deaf. Well, I am not too knowledgeable about the terms, but I think she would count as deaf. She can hear loud sounds, and sometimes even the sound of someone talking. She cannot understand what people are saying though. Which seems odd, because she can speak fine (although a tad bit on the loud side).A year ago I transferred colleges, and I now live 3 hours away. This makes communication rather difficult with her. Yes, we have a way to call her. I think she has what is called a TTY machine, and we call her through Illinois Relay service. The thing is, it kind of feels impersonal and kind of bothersome because of the operator in the middle.A while back, we tried getting her a computer and having her contact us through Facebook. I thought this was a great idea because she could check it throughout the day, or once a day and we could have a conversation. The trouble was, I basically had one day to teach her. That did not go well. My dad basically told me at the time that I would have to be the one to teach her. I know my brother and sister don't have the patience to do it either. So, we had to return it.What sparks my interest in this again is that I am now worried for her. I just found out she was shoveling snow over the winter to get out, and got hurt (my family is very bad at communication). I will call everyday and check on her from now on, but I was wondering something.Is there some better way you have found at communicating long distance? Is there some better way to teach her how to use a computer? She watches a lot of TV with the captions on. Is there a good program on DVD with captions that teaches elderly to use a computer?Thanks in advance for any answers.Edit: trying to format well, and failing \n",

Is there any HOH waiters and or waitresses out there that have advice on how to talk to customers and coworkers when they get frustrated that I'm needing to ask them to repeat themselves?Also, the owner likes the music to be loud. I know this because I know someone that works at the restaurant and that person told me about how an employee had turned down the music one day because it was loud, and then the owner came in and yelled at that employee for turning the music down. I might try and ask the owner if he could accommodate me by having the music at a lower volume.Also, there are employees there that have accents. I spoke to one of them today when I dropped off paperwork, and gosh that was tough. It was difficult to both understand what he was saying because of his accent and because of how loud the music was.I've been trying to stay away from waitress jobs because of being impaired, but it seems impossible. For years I've applied to so many jobs where I would have a minimal interaction with customers because I'm HOH.If this job does not end up working out for me, does anyone have suggestions on places or positions I should apply for?

This is definitely a dumb question, I know that because I can't even find a single other person asking it, (perhaps because I don't know the terminology or wording) so I apologize in advance.My question is, what is inside of an eye socket if you lose your eye? I, like many others, expected a \"glass eye\" to be a full ball. But it's just a front. So what is in the back of the socket? Is the eye still in there? I thought that losing an eye meant that the eye would need to be removed. Looking at people with prosthetic eyes, I can see pink when they take it out. What is that? My guess is, there are two things, one is the eye is deflated and shrunk, where you can only insert a front, which is a common thing, and why I see pink. Maybe it's less common for someone to have an entire eyeball removed, because of mere chance. If this happens, I would assume you could put a whole fake eye \"ball\" back in there, because of the empty space, but I've never seen this.It's a jumble of questions, but any insight on this would be very interesting.

Smell a disgusting odor, scrunch up the nose & mouth and squint the eyes. Feeling puzzled or searching for an answer, the eyes roll around & the mouth opens hangs open.

      "Idea for a pokemon rom hack for blind people I myself am not blind but I wanted to share this idea with the blind community on reddit for input.I saw a video on accessibility in video games and thought that if I learned how to do a rom hack or commission someone to rom hack one of the generation 4 pokemon games (Pokemon: Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum) to make it accessible to the visually impaired.I chose the generation 4 games on the nintendo DS for a few reasons1. the ds can handle text to speech software as showcased in Tomodachi Collection released in Japan.2. Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum take up less data storage than generation 5 of Pokemon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 (128 Megabytes vs 512 Megabytes) thus there is more room for modification within the 512 Megabyte storage of the Nintendo DS Game System.3. The game's navigation is in a grid based movement system, with some user interface navigation controlled by a 4 direction D-Pad, Touch Screen, Start & Select buttons, and X Y A B buttons.Some ideas on how the game would function would be via the use of the DS Rumble Pak (an accessory for the DS made to vibrate when given input from the game, and auditory cues via a text to speech system)Examples include:\\-Auditory cues for arriving in routes, towns, cities, and other locations.\\-Vibration feedback for encountering a wild pokemon, as well as audio descriptions for said pokemon such as it's name, level, and if it's registered to the pokedex.\\-Reading aloud character and user interface dialogue, as well as narrated actions taking place in cutscenes.\\-Increased volume for the \"Sparkle\" sound effect encountering wild shiny pokemon ( pokemon of a different color with a 1 in 8000 chance to encounter.\\-Audio cues for when pokemon are at full health, half health, or below half health in battle, as well as audio for reading aloud moves in battle Such as: \"Rollout, Rock-Physical, The user continually rolls into the foe over five turns. It becomes stronger each time it hits.\"\"Perish Song, Normal-Status, Any Pokémon that hears this song faints in three turns unless it switches out of battle.\"\"Ice Beam, Ice-Special, The foe is struck with an icy-cold beam of energy.

      "Lip Reading Hi everyone,this is my first time posting in this subreddit, even though I've been a part of it for about a year or so.I've been struggling with my hearing since January 2014. Though according to the hearing test back then my hearing was still above average in all frequencies, despite there being an obvious difference between my left and my right ear (left side was better than right). So while I was noticing the difference, I was told I had perfect hearing and not to worry.Fast forward to the beginning of 2021. After months of isolation and little to no in-person contact, I moved back to my home country (and thus back in with my parents). It was than that I noticed that there are certain things I can't hear at all (e.g. our cat snoring) and that I struggle to hear & understand human voices.So I got a new hearing test and my hearing (especially in the middle frequency) had dropped just below the threshold of when insurance companies over here cover hearing aids. My HA made a difference and I'm really grateful for that technology as I need to be able to hear in my job.My hearing is continuing to get worse, though (I need to see my audiologist). One on one situations are fine, but meetings are getting more difficult. No one here knows sign. (In fact the only person in my life who is fluent in ASL is my therapist.) So I'm trying to learn to lip read, hoping that it'll help me, but for the life of me I seem to be unable to do it.Tl;dr:So hear is my question: Do any of you have any tips how to learn to lip read? P.S.: Sorry for the long prelude to my question. \n",

      "Travel magnifier to use in archives? I’m physically disabled and recently learned that I have low vision. For my job, I do research in historical archives with documents that are all over the place in terms of text size, contrast, etc. I need a travel magnifier with a light that can also increase contrast (and possibly more; if it could increase space between lines, for example, that would be great). I’m usually trying to skim documents quickly, to figure out what to scan and read at home later. Because of my physical disability, it’s hard for me to hold a tablet, for example, for long periods at a time (unless there were some kind of ergonomic handle attachment?). (Also, I have accommodative dysfunction, so staring at a backlit screen for magnification isn’t ideal.)Any recommendations? My employer will probably pay for it as an accommodation, but I don’t want to ask them to break the bank if I don’t have to. \n",

      "Are there any actually fashionable talking wristwatches? Hello everyone,I am looking for an easy-to-use but also good looking wristwatch that audibly tells the time to the wearer for my blind mother.So the requirements are: good durability, very easy to use, stand-alone and a if possible a rechargable internal battery duration of at least a few days (if non rechargable a lot longer).Some additional info (pretty long ramble, so beware):Since she has gone blind at the age of 35, we have been buying these plastic ones that cost around 50€ as they also have an analog working watchface and she likes if it looks like a \"normal\" watch.The problem with these is that they break so fast and it seems like their quality is on a decline. We bought two last year alone and the second one hasn't even held up for 3 months.The company that produces and sells them does not want to repair them as it \"would not be economical for them\" (since they are so cheap anyway).They break in different ways: Most often just the contact that the time-telling button presses on breaks off of the board or the speaker stops working. The batteries in them actually last longer than the watches most of the time.Other types of watches for blind people are not an option for her unfortunately. Learning braille was very hard and frustrating for her and she gave up at some point, the one with the metal ball is \"not precise enough\" for her (regarding reading it), same for the one with the openable watchface.A smartwatch or fitbit would also be an option if:A) You could use it without a smartphone.B) Is very simple to use for a person that is not techsavvy at all.C) A hard first time setup would not be a problem as I could do that.I would also try to build her her own smartwatch without a screen, just a speaker, two buttons and a voice assistant with additional features other than telling the time or date (like a smart home device) when she is at home. But this turns out to be very hard as most DIY platforms focus on the screen, do not have a speaker that could reproduce more than just beeps and finding fitting speakers and microphones this size are very hard to find for amateurs like me.I hope you can help us in any way. \n",

      "Which sign language should I learn? For context, I am a hearing person looking to learn a sign language to be able to communicate with a broader range of people. I was HOH as a small child and learned the very basics of Maritime sign language (MSL), which is a dying language on Canada's east coast. As my grandparents age and I think about my future children, I would like to be able to communicate in a way that doesn't always include speaking. Add to the mix that we will be raising our children francophone and have a lot of family in Quebec. ASL seems like it would be the easiest to learn, but almost feels like it would be going against my roots of MSL and I don't know how useful it would be for my future francophone children. Which brings us to LSQ, which would probably be the most useful, but as I live in a bilingual place, ASL is still more prominent. In writing this out, I'm leaning towards learning LSQ while also digging to find out anything I can about MSL since ressources are extremely limited, but what are your opinions? \n",

      "I want to become friends with a deaf kid at my classroom, but am afraid learning sign language can be seen as disrespectful. So, hello! I'm a hearing person from a third world country, here we do have sign language but most people don't know how to use it. I just started the school year and in my class (I'm on High School) there is a deaf boy who looks very cool, he is very lonly and no one in our class can use sign language, not even the teachers. (We only have one classrom for all the year in my country) He sits by himself and normally I would never had noticed him, what caught my attention was that he is actually, very funny.There is this teacher on our school that is quite bad, he looks to have a lot of problems with disable students, he doesn't like me since I have autism and I just asked him if he was making a joke or being serious. Anyway, in our first day he yelled at the deaf boy and even called him out saying \"speak correctly!\", besides this bad incident, the teacher does treat him pretty bad, not looking at him when he is talking (what makes it imposible to lip reading) and I noticed the boy mock the teacher when he isn't looking. Is very funny and I don't think anyone else noticed.This made me want to be friends with him, but because of my autism I don't know very well how to aproach people, I decided to start learning sign language so he could have someone to talk to in class and also to see if this could make us becoming friends easier.But I'm afraid this can be seen as disrespectful? I'm not the best with social cues, but I really want to talk to him, just don't know how I can approach him without looking stupid? I'm very good with languages too, being able to understand visual information quickly, so I don't think sign language will be very difficult for me. (I also don't know if this is the right place for this kind of answer, I will take it down immediately if it's against any rule or just a stupid question) \n",

      "Writing sci-fi story, seeking info on ASL and Deaf culture I've been writing an extremely weird science-fiction story, and am about to start in on a part of it in which at least one sign language will be used. Can anyone here suggest useful, interesting, or offbeat bits of data on the topic, that haven't made it into the general Wikipedia article on ASL, which I might want to include?Some background: In 2050, in an apocalypse similar to some descriptions of the 'Singularity', nearly everyone in an urban area disappears, and almost all radio is jammed. By some decades later, a number of people have been altered by strange pieces of technology into not-quite-human forms. One group finds themselves rebuilt to be able to survive in outer space without a space suit - including being able to communicate with each other without air or radios. (They even have patches of bio-luminescent skin, so it should be possible for them to sign to each other in the dark.)While the general technology level in the much-reduced population is roughly 19th century, enough rural libraries will have survived for textbooks on ASL to be easy enough to find. However, with so many people gone and long-range communications severed, I'm not sure how much Deaf culture would be able to survive in this scenario. The space-engineered people will have been created in Cincinatti, but had to migrate to Cleveland; are there any Deaf communities or resources in that region? Are there any common audist pitfalls that I should avoid? Are there any significant changes to Deaf culture that are likely to arise in the next 35 years? How hard would it be to adapt the American manual alphabet to a related alphabet with 40 letters, \"Unifon\" ( [ )?One significant character has been stuck in the body of a human-sized anthropomorphic rabbit with pink fur, uses the name Bunny Waldeinsamkeit, and claims to be the Queen of Canada (and of other places that are further away and less important).

They made it sound like a counselling group where people console each other for having parents who used them.Is there any truth to this?

I got fascinated with the deaf culture and their language, and also I might have some hearing loss in nearly 2 or 3 years, it could get worse.Also, my friend's mother is deaf, and I want to communicate with her without having his son interpreting me, but I won't if I don't find a way to become more fluent.Is there a way in ASL that would work with other Sign Languages? \n",

      "Working with others As I've started to lose my hearing, I've been able to adapt well, I feel, but no one around me seems to want to work with me. My mother knows ASL fluently (used to interpret) but refuses to sign with me since it is just easier to talk for her. I'm not fluent. She started teaching me and I've researched, but with no one to practice with, it's extremely difficult to hold on to. My sister has straight up told me she has no interest. My boyfriend keeps telling me he wants to learn, but every time I ask if he wants to sit down it's just not a good time for him. At work I've told everyone about my issues, but they still don't quite get it. The lack of communication causes me to miss orders sometimes. As well, my friends will get together in our group and talk to me all at once. I guess my issue here, guys, is that I don't know how to work with a bunch of hearing people who don't know how to work with me. It's especially heartbreaking with my family and friends. I feel left out constantly because I just simply can't follow along with conversations. I've gotten to a point where I basically sit silent in my room all day, go to work and do a \"deaf job\" such as dishes where no one has to talk to me, and catch on occasionally when I hang out once in a blue moon. How do I adjust so communication isn't so crappy with everyone? How do you keep deafness from shutting you away from the rest of the world? \n",

      "What Is A Toy And What Is A Tool? Since people got a little bit aggravated about a previous post I want to ask this question, what is a toy and what is a tool?The answer is it can be both, you can make a toy into a tool. A large print sticker label maker, The sticker lasts a couple of months before starting to fade. Lighthouse for the Blind sells it $189 and $20 for 2 rolls of sticker paper....But what about a kids toy that is a Bluetooth sticker maker?  It thermal prints as well on sticker paper. Print it out landscape and bold you get a bold black lettering on white sticker paper that's 36 point size....on a $30 kids printer with a cat face on it and 12 rolls white sticker paper for $10 and the sticker lasts just as long as the $189 unit.The difference between a tool and a toy is what you make it. Took my friend to the lighthouse and the price markup is obscene, not everyone has $210 to make temporary large print stickers.My respiratory and mobility aids are ungodly expensive so I try to repurpose other stuff to make it into accessibility tools. \n",

      "Is it bad that I’m afraid of working? This sounds so stupid and like an excuse for laziness but I don’t think that it is. So for background, I’m 16 and I‘m visually impaired. I’m extremely near sighted, lack depth perception, have a lesser visual field amongst other things. Because of my age and upcoming university applications in the next year, work experience is a fundamental focus in my life. Due to the age that we live in thankfully lots of it is virtual which works out great for me but I also need to do some in person, which is terrifying but I think I can suck it up especially after learning how to use a white cane. So I suppose whilst it is daunting, I can do it.The thing that I don‘t think I can do is hold down is an actual part time job. Right now, I‘m a tutor but the thing is the job is through my school and I’m pretty sure it ends at the end of this academic year and we only do a one hour session once a week so I just need to think more long term. The job itself is great and not to demanding at all since it’s only one hour a week. What I’ve realised is I’m going to need something that brings in more money down the line. My parents pay the bills, buy the groceries, pay for my lunches and my other needs. But I’m starting to need more and they just can’t provide and I honestly couldn’t expect them too. However, I don’t think that I could work retail or fast food as being a student is proving to be difficult enough right now. I have nystagmus, it causes my vision to fluctuate and it’s been putting me through absolute hell recently. Getting all my school work done is extremely difficult and my extra curricula’s just feel impossible most days. Even if I did have the time for a part time job, I don’t see how my vision will allow for it as I can’t read labels and most screens without some form of text to speech reader. In the UK, PIP seems like it’s the solution but I feel like Ill get rejected because I’ve been told they find any reason under the sun to deem people as too competent. Also it states that I need to have difficulties doing everyday tasks- I mean technically I do, and I don’t. But more so need the money for the aforementioned reasons which don’t really relate to everyday tasks. Should I not apply for this reason? But then additionally, at some point I will absolutely need the money in university as I will need to fund my own expenses, I don’t know I just feel bad for some reason. \n",

I was wondering how Deaf people learn to read if they can't associate letters with different sounds. A hearing child can sound out a word they don't know, so once they've memorized the alphabet and what sounds go with what letters, they can figure out how a written word sounds and connect it to a spoken word they've heard before. For someone who doesn't use a spoken language, how do they connect written letters to a meaning? Do you just have to memorize, like we do with signs or spoken words? \n",

It's confusing to get around in for anyone with all the different routes.  Lots of people traffic at all times.As I was coming back in from a smoke break, I noticed 2 blind boys, about 12-13 years old.  They both had dark glasses on and were walking with canes.  They were by themselves as far as I could tell.  The kids had come up from my building's lobby area, so I knew they came in the 'wrong' way if they wanted to go to the restaurants or stores.  They were walking very slowly and seemed hesitant.Given their age and the environment, I wanted to be like a friendly resident of the area and offer directions.Would it have been inappropriate to say, 'Hey guys, welcome to the building.  Are you going anyway specific I can help you with?  It's confusing here.'What should I do if it happens again with another blind person? \n",

I honestly have only been in contact with about 3 deaf people in my entire life. My son was born premature, and he also has extra chromosomes - very rare his type of gene sequencing. Friday we had a second ABR test done (he is 4 months adjusted - almost 6 months actual) and found out that he has profound hearing loss in both ears. I have an appointment with the  ENT to go over the diagnosis, and start the discussion for hearing aids and cochlear implants. I've already done a lot of research. I would like to go both routes of developing language through baby sign and ASL, and the hearing route of medical technology. Currently my son is being watched by my husbands aunt who is from the Dominican Republic. Where she is from is very country. I tried to explain the sign for \"Milk\" and to show my son every time she feeds him a bottle. She understood a little. The next day my husband explains it to her in Spanish.  She told him they don't do that in the DR - and if hes going to get hearing aides why do it because he will be able to hear. I showed him a video of a catholic missionary in Santo Domingo who worked with Deaf children, she signed. they were signing. She said these kids would not be in school if not for them. The kids were like 13 and some came to them not knowing their name. Of course his aunt doesn't know anything about Deaf children - she prob hasn't met them or they stay in doors - the whole deaf/mute. I was so upset and I fear that is the first of his family that will just not understand. She can't provide anything of value except take care of his basic needs. He needs more than that.

It does not have inverted colors and is a small screenHe asked if they could take provide photos of the things he needs to identify so he could view on a high contract computer screen in and they said no.My boyfriend will NOT be able see the cadaver to take an exam.

      "Could a low sighted or blind person give me a walk-through of their day? It's to make a blind character more believable. I know this isn't terribly life-shaking, but I'm playing in an RPG where we all are randomly assigned various traits and disadvantages. I drew \"blind\". Now, I usually write a series of stories to go along with games as a sort of adventure log, so I like to research backgrounds a little. With that in mind I asked a friend of mine who is legally blind what her day is like. She said her day is very different from most blind people's because she is also in a wheelchair, and my character is sound in body. So, at her suggestion, I am asking here. The game is set in the modern world, and my character lives independently for the most part, though another player is her roommate. According to the gamemaster she is totally blind and has been since birth. Any tips? \n",

I suggested getting a cane as that’s what they are for. She mentioned a number of issues with that, mostly that we have no idea where to get one or how to use it, and how much it might cost to buy one and learn how to use it. She was also concerned about the optics of using one as it would make her look like, in her words “a helpless idiot”. I assured her that people wouldn’t care, but she’s still concerned about the optics of using one.

      "Seeking psychiatric help I am legally blind and 24 years old. I am only sighted in my right eye, which was last examined to be 20/200. 6 months ago I was given a scare, told that my retina was detached and that I needed surgery. That same week the doctor caught COVID and I Wasn't able to undergo surgery - I was sent to a major eye hospital in the South where after 2 visits I was told by a doctor \"actually you don't have retina detachment but we need to monitor you\".  So the last 7-8 months I've been under regular monitoring. First 2 weeks, then 3, then a month, now 2 months - the next visit will be in February. Thing is, I can't describe what I am feeling, whether it is part of my glaucoma or retinaschesis. I ttold the doctor that I see these kind of wavy.. ripples?... in the very periphery of my vision. It doesn't impact my central vision, but it does happen often enough if I really pay attention. In my eentral vision I sometimes see flashing lights when I wake up in a crescent moon/C shape, which last maybe 1 second before going away. Otherwise my central vision feels normal as it's ever been.. which is to say not great but servicable.I have been hyper-vigilant regarding my eye health, to the point where I frankly am scared of going blind every day.  Even when the doctor wrote on her chart that my condition is stable, she also wrote that if things get worse I'm to undergo surgery. I am wondering if there's therapists or phsychiatrists who specialize in this kind of blindness grief or fear? I know rationally that life will go on, but my living situation is tenuou - I already can't drive and am homebound living in the suburbs, no paratransit or cane training available, thanks South Carolina.. I am trying to save every penny I can while working part time for 15/hr because nobody pays above 40k here.. it's just a lot of weight on my mind. When I'm not working at my job I basically am writing or editing videos to potentially earn more income. To be able to speak to a therapist or psychiatrist (sidenote: is one licensed, the other isn't?) I feel would help my mental health out a lot and get me to be sort of at peace with this.

      "In my view, deafness is a personal journey. There are many paths, and none are wrong. NONE. Now, I've been around for since my birth - 40 years ago. I'm grateful that I've made it this far, because the longer I've lived, the more I've learned about humanity... and myself. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that I've been deaf since birth. That plays a major part in what I'm about to state from this point on...I'm sure there are many in the community that are like myself: we feel comfortable in what the hearing folk would call \"the silence\". Unbeknownst to many, there is sound within the so-called silence. We constantly see pictures, videos, and text in out minds' eyes - while we're going about our everyday business. With any kind of stimuli available in place of the hearing senses, there is no way the term of \"silence\" can be applied in this case. Our brains are *BUZZING* with constant input of non-aural origins; therefore one's mind is always noisy inside or out. Sometimes, in these who can hear.. these sub-lying noises can often be belayed by audible sounds in the surroundings. The problem is that the majority would rather view that silent world as a bleak one: *With such soul-eating loneliness that must be eating away at us, we're beings devoid of humanity\"*. I'm here to say that's not so, at least not in my personal point of view.My co-workers rely on music to pass the time while they're on the job. As for me, I have something else that I find equally (and awesomely) stimulating. This distracting, yet appeasing pastime is as old as mankind itself: Thoughts. Admit it - if you filtered out all the sounds you could, what would your brain do? Adapt. I don't really notice it, since I'm in auto-drive mode, but they're there - all these images, videos, and simulated audio running in the background. My thoughts are like that, amplified yet set aside. I'm sure the hearing folk regard background music in a similar concept - just something to keep one pacified while doing unpleasant tasks. Either one keeps the mind occupied while going through the motions of the same old shit - day in and day out. My personal conclusion: There is NO such thing as \"silence\", when it comes to these who cannot hear. However, I'm always open to whatever other people think on this subject. Thanks! \n",

The situation seems to be that there's only one board of the same members that represent the language as a whole, and they are pretty inconsistent with their grading scale. Even as a certificatee specifically emphasizes certain patterns or were aware of others less emphasized, the commentary would remain the same. There is also speculation that they're discriminating against hearing testers as there's remarks that deaf people who use less ASL vs English are being certified when some hearing people who are comparatively more strictly ASL oriented are being rejected. It's great that we're inclusive for the Deaf, but there are many great hearing signers as well. It also is extremely frustrating considering testers pay $140 for the examination process.My mom doesn't reddit, so this is just my hearsay. What have you heard?

      "How many visits does it usually take to tweak a brand new digital hearing aid? Hi!I'll be visiting my new audiologist in over a week to do more tweakings on my new Oticon Sumo DM digital headband bone conduction hearing aid (still get a few annoying feedbacks and echoes, and need more tweakings) after about 35 years of wearing analog hearing aids.I read some users had to go many times and drove their audiologists crazy. I hope I don't do that and hopefully my (3/thi)rd time will be the last one/1. It seems digital is too complex with so many variables and options. This must be a pain to do for every new hearing aid too. :/Thank you in advance. :) \n",

      "Issue With Zoom on iPad OS 16 Hi guys, Has anyone else had an issue with zoom since updating to iPad OS 16? I started to notice straight away that my screen wasn’t responding to my inputs properly. It would only register the touch say 80% of the time, making it very difficult to use. I had no idea what was causing the issue. I asked around, and only one other person had the issue, my friend who is also VI and also uses zoom, although we didn’t realise it had anything to do with that. Anyway, weeks later, I just switched off zoom temporarily because I was doing something wear I needed to use three fingers without it zooming in. Immediately I noticed that the issue had gone. I switched zoom back on, and it came back. Basically, zoom had been causing the issue. Has anyone else found the same? \n",

I wasn't able to get far in college because of my disabilities.One example was trying to take notes in class. I had to either use a pocket magnifier or walk up close to the board to read anything on it. So it was much slower for me to take notes than for other students. Even at my fastest, I would be about halfway through trying to write out math notes and then the teacher would move on and erase the notes from the board to make room for more.Should I have demanded the teachers slow down to accommodate for my disability to allow me to finish taking notes? \n",

      "New remote job, feeling insecurity about blindness Hey everyone. Hope everybody is having a great new year. My new year started off with a new remote job after having been laid off last month, so I’m pretty happy I found somewhere else to land without having to go on unemployment. That said, it’s my first week on the job and I’m feeling especially nervous and self-conscious about my blindness.Of the three interviews, I told the last guy I interviewed with about my vision impairment and he seemed to respond just fine, like OK cool. No big deal to us, basically. Then, when I was filling out on boarding paperwork, one of the forms asked if I had a disability. When I said yes, it then prompted me to type in any accommodations I might like to request, so I did. So, at two different points I disclose to the company that I’m blind, yet the guy I’m actually reporting to apparently had no idea. I sent him an email my first day saying I would need administrative rights to install a screen reader because of my visual disability. He wrote back and was totally cool with that but when we spoke later that day I asked him if that’s the first he had heard that I was visually impaired and he said it was. Again, same positive attitude from him, but it’s just uncomfortable. Now I’m hopping on all these calls with various departments and people and nobody has any idea. There’s all kinds of screen sharing and visual stuff going on and I have no idea what’s on anyone’s screens, of course. I don’t think I’m missing much just yet, but soon I will be meeting with my fellow engineers and will have to tell them about it one by one, again it coming as a surprise to each of them.This isn’t my first remote job but I wasn’t quite so uncomfortable 18 months ago when I did this at the start of my prior job. I think it’s because I told that hiring manager much earlier on in the process and I got the impression by the time of my first panel interview, everybody probably knew… Though in hindsight, they may not have. Maybe that’s the trick – just convincing myself people already know lol. Does anyone have any tips for navigating this awkward first few weeks on the job? I just worry people have preconceptions and stereotypes and when they find out I am blind they will wonder why the hell I got hired or how I’m going to do the work. Obviously I will be proving to them both of those things, but it does make me self-conscious. It’s also especially difficult in a remote environment where it’s not like somebody can see me walking in with my white cane. \n",

      "at the age of 32 and not part of deaf culture I find myself at a loss for where to begin.. Around my 24th year I started being told I was not paying attention to people, or rudely walking out or a room when being spoke to.  Many people began to believe I was just very stuck up.  I slowly noticed a need to face or see people in order to hear them. Speaking in dark rooms was impossible, social situations became awkward, and job interviews became difficult.  Friends became accustomed to repeating things with glazed indifference and lovers became used to misunderstandings.  I just thought I was a little hard of hearing and it would be fixable somewhere down the line.  Two years ago after urgings from my partner and being added to a great insurance plan through him I got my first audiogram.  I learned I have Bilateral Mixed Severe-Profound Progressive hearing loss caused by genetics.  I accepted this as it is and began wearing Oticon Pro Nera hearing aids in both ears.  It changed my life positively and significantly. I continued to pursue a career in event production.  I had my genetic panel taken to find whether I would pass this on to my children should I chose to have them.6 months into my life with hearing aids I noticed it once again was becoming difficult to hear people.  I went in for my annual audiogram and learned it was progressing and I had lost 25% of my word clarity in one of my ears within that year.  Now a year later I am having the same issues.  Its like I am as hard of hearing with my hearing aids as I used to feel without them. Next week I go in for another audiogram and to discuss my options and eligibility to begin the Cochlear Implant process. I have to admit I am terrified and confused and scared.  Facing such a huge change is confusing.  I have seen how isolating my hearing loss is already and I am frightened of the implications this has to change everything.I was a foster child who was never adopted so I do not have a family who will help emotionally support me, or learn ASL to communicate with me.  I have moved many times to major cities in my pursuit of a career that now seems impossible in my near future.  This means I do not have a large support system or long term close friends who might be willing to put up with the adjustments to my new lifestyle. I'm intimidated by facing what some people I've read on here are calling an \"adjustment\" but it will literally change the course and direction of my entire being.   I just do not know where to start and I am looking for guidance and understanding from a group of people I know little to nothing about. \n",

      "Is there a minimum degree of hearing loss to use (American) sign language? As some background, I have a ~27 db hearing loss, and have never really been able to hear if there's much background noise. It has become worse recently, as the amount of noise needed to be a problem is much lower and I also occasionally mishear or rarely completely miss something even in a relatively quiet environment.Today, I was out at a restaurant with friends, and, being rather busy, it was a little noisy. While my friends didn't have any issues, I did, and had to frequently ask for people to repeat themselves. One person in particular admonished me for not paying attention. When the server came by to take drink orders, I couldn't really understand her, so I signed my order in addition to saying it. She responded in ASL and kept signing to me. While I'm not yet fluent in ASL, it was definitely easier than trying to use spoken english, so I gave her a very large \"thank you\" and left her a fairly large tip for that.Later, one of my friends messaged me stating that my use of ASL was extremely offensive. My friend also stated that by stating that I am \"a little hard of hearing\", I was \"literally appropriating the struggles of the hearing impaired\". I am still rather new to anything related to the Deaf community, so I may be the one in the wrong here, but this just seems odd, and I would like some outside opinions on this. \n",

If both kettles were going it was a judgement call on if the popcorn was fully done. My partner told me it grew softer when done, I was utterly confused as I could not hear this. It is so irritating.

Myself and tens of thousands of others in their early 30s have a very distinct and vivid memory of The Bearenstain Bears being spelled b-e-a-r-e-n-s-t-e-i-n when we read the books as children.

      "Other eye condition & struggling to get low vision diagnosis I'm looking for a bit of advice. I have severe dry eye due to MGD - the glands that are supposed to secrete oils to coat the eye pretty much don't. Apparently that's due to scar tissue in the glands and an unusually small opening where tears should reach the eye. Any tears that are produced evaporate almost instantly and are of terrible quality. I've been getting treatments for this issue, but the problem is that I can't get  doctors to even check my vision. My vision has deteriorated severely in the last few months. I'm not sure if it is part of this issue, or if it's something completely separate. I feel like my visual acuity fluctuates wildly and is highly dependent on the temperature and amount of wind or air conditioning. How can I get a doctor to take me seriously about the vision loss? I've started using a white cane in the past few weeks and have been seriously struggling with schoolwork. I've been lucky to have supportive professors, but I feel like I'm on my own. I have glasses and have gotten two major prescription strength increases over the past year, but my glasses aren't going to solve the vision loss. Does anyone have a similar story or advice? \n",

I make use of t the OS' full screen zoom due to my visual impairment and also have it set to follow focus text as I type it. I have recently noticed a bug while using it with Microsoft Word. Wherever I zoom in and begin typing, particularly when the cursor is towards the page edges, the focus goes crazy and jumps to a a different part of the page, sending my current text string off screen, or even sometimes it will jump to another page entirely before possibly jumping back afterwards I type a few more characters for whatever reason. I tested using zoom in the Notes and Pages apps, neither had any issues. I also fiddled around with some of the follow focus settings in the advanced section of that menu. It made no difference.  I've concluded the issues is most likely with the Word app, other Mac users tend to agree with me. I don't know if there's anything kind of fix or workaround. I'm paying a monthly subscription for Office 365 but I don't see the point of continuing if Word is left inaccessible to my needs. \n",

      "Need help with unidentified old NFB canes, bought cane tips that are too small. Hi, I've had these 2 fiberglass canes since I got them in 2005 from the now defunct Kansas Center for the Blind. Not even sure if they were brand new then. One is smooth, one is grooved all the way down its length so it would go zzzip if you ran your fingernail down it. I prefer walking long distances with them over my standard aluminum folding canes. The metal tips don't get caught in all the cracks of the broken sidewalks we have here in town, and they're lighter. I know they're NFB canes, but that's it. One of them has an address in Baltimore, telephone number and website, but no model number or size. So I bought some ct415 cane tips from Lighthouse thinking they would fit all nfb canes, but the hole is way too small on the tips I just got. One cane has a rubber nub, the other one has a screw, and both old tips seem to have the same sized hole. There's no writing on the tips at all. I've never had to replace the tips on these before. Does anyone here have any idea how many different sizes nfb tips have been, and what sizes are larger than the ct415? I have a bad feeling I won't be able to get tips that fit these anymore from what I've been reading about how NFB changed the widths of their canes. Thanks. \n",

So I will be playing music at normal volumes, and if I’m interacting with the phone voiceover will be at normal volumes, but it will randomly just start doing the voiceover thing at full volume on the phone and I can’t figure out what’s triggering it and if this is a bug or if this is an issue, but I went through all the settings and I checked the speaker and I don’t know what it could be.  So VoiceOver will balance between normal volume and maximum volume quite a lot.This is on an iPhone 14 promax with the latest version of Spotify and the latest firmware for iOS plus the speaker was updated from its stock firmware to the latest version of its firmware.This does not happen when using Bluetooth headphones since I have two different pairs, and I have been using them for ages with Spotify with zero issues.Any thoughts or ideas or am I just missing something obvious somewhere that I need to turn on or off. \n",

      "Wondering if my neighbor is actually fully blind My mom is from Bangladesh, so she’s witnessed & heard of plenty of people who are not fully blind, but pretend to be in order to get financial & other benefits. I’m wondering if my neighbor in NY is doing the same.He’s a white man above 70, lives alone in a house just like mine, so 4 bedrooms, 2 large living rooms, 2.5 bathrooms, a garage, etc. I was 19 (brown female) at the time and used to take him on walks, he wrapped his arm around mine. He was so happy to have a friend, because most of the neighbors don’t say hi to him even though he sits on his steps in front of the door nearly everyday. He told me he listens to the radio on those steps, his wife died a decade ago but they had this house together with no other residents, and his nephew comes from Florida every few weeks to check in. We don’t live walking distance to anything, it’s not like the city. Said he has a whole gym setup downstairs and regularly cleans his entire house.He asked me to order him clothes on my phone, to deliver at his house and paid with a gift visa. When we first met he told me he’s fully blind at birth, and after a couple weeks he said he lied; that’s what he tells most ppl bc he doesn’t like when ppl ask questions, but he wants to admit to me that he lost his full vision after a classmate hit him in the eyes around middle school. Given that he’s very old I assume there wasn’t proper tech to support his vision as much as if it happened in modern time. He said he worked at a nyc cancer research center for a long time, but I can’t remember what his position was. I can’t understand what a fully blind person can do there.I stopped talking to him because he always pushed highly political topics like 9/11 and trump, judgmental, and seemed to want a lot of sympathy. The reason I took him on walks is bc I wanted a neighborly friendship but after one guy passed away no one really talks anymore.Today I saw him cleaning his floor and entrance door for almost 10 minutes. Anyway I was just curious, based on his odd character and for lying originally, if he’s lying again. \n",

      "[rant] BS video of \"29 year old hearing for the first time\" This video gets posted so much on social media and everybody eats it up. She says she has been deaf her whole life but the procedure she had is NOT a cochlear implant, it is an implanted hearing aid and a weak one at that with a max gain of only 50dB.Even without hearing aids she would hear her own voice.She went on the Ellen show and Ellen paid for a second device (Esteem implant which is only for moderate hearing loss).People with no prior expierence with hearing loss and deafness have a good cry and think \"aww what a sweet story\" but it is just a bunch of bs. Insurance didn't cover the surgery because it has a high failure rate and has no benefits over hearing aids except that it is all within the head.what pisses me and others off is that this feel good video is NOT a deaf woman hearing for the first time. It is a woman with mild to moderate hearing loss getting really expensive hearing aids and crying a bunch. And then writing a book (about what? She was never deaf).So people who are actually deaf see this video and think oh, that will be me if I get a cochlear implant (in the video she never says that she didn't have a cochlear implant). I wish Ellen would do a quick clarification about this.  * 1. She wasn't audiologically or culturally deaf* 2. She had hearing that was pretty great with hearing aids* 3. She had a surgery that will leave her with a conduction hearing loss because they disarticulate the ossicles during surgery* 4. Because of 3 she will end up with worse hearing when the device fails* 5. The device has a pretty high rate of rejection and requires another surgery every 4-8 years.Edit- if you feel like it, when you see the video on Facebook take a second to educate people about the utter BS spouted in the video. \n",

I get headaches all the time because of it, they make me want to just lie down and fall asleep. I used to be so academically oriented and then I got my first major exam results and realised that I have to try so much harder than everyone else just to be average and it’s so depressing and honestly embarrassing because people see how hard I try and then ask me why I don’t get better results. Now that school is actually starting to matter and I have to start thinking about university, I don’t have it in me anymore.   I can’t work harder than everyone else for the next two years only to be bellow average. I can’t.

      "Minor hearing loss Hey guys! A quick question to try and get some clarification/understanding. Background info - lost all my hearing in one ear and have roughly <5% natural hearing in the other due to a childhood illness. Have had very good aided hearing for roughly 17 years. I've had a confirmed minor hearing loss in the higher ranges of my hearing. This ties in with me starting a new job that requires me to use a phone anywhere between 6-8 hours a day taking and placing calls.To be able to hear on the phone, volume has had to be at the very loudest possible setting, with my hearing aid turned up to the loudest setting too. This was loud enough to cause the my hearing mould and the headset that I wear to vibrate quite regularly due to the loudness, but it meant that I could hear. The headset is just a regular headset, with the cup placed over the microphones of my hearing aid when using. What are the chances that the headset/hearing aid set up  and loudness of the sound have caused this loss? The audiologist couldn't say for sure, but I can't think of anything else that could have caused it. Thanks!  \n",

At the age of 23 and born profoundly deaf I still find it incredibly challenging, frustrating and tiring trying to engage socially with people who can hear. I thought this would pass as a child though grown up more I realise the greater extent of how my hearing loss actually limits me and I find it harder to hear people now than before. Is it common to feel anxious all the time in conversation? I try very hard to simply listen to others though fear when I mishear them. I feel embarrassed having to ask others to repeat themselves often because a lot of the time i'm eventually met with ' Oh, it doesn't matter' or 'Nevermind'. Though to me it matters a lot.I try not to take it personally though as a result I can feel rejected, not included in conversations a lot of the time on a daily basis.  I think I just have to accept it though it doesn't feel fun. I feel like an idiot because how little people understand my speech or ability to not hear others well.I feel envious of others who are able to interact with others.

She has very limited (around 5%) vision in her peripheral of one eye, the other has zero vision. About a year after losing her sight she went to a prestigious school in California and trained and received a beautiful service dog. Since then the dogs training and discipline have been rapidly declining. She started off walking and taking the dog everywhere and is was very well behaved.  Over the years she has become less active and interested in going places on her own, the dogs behavior inside the the house has completely fallen apart, it jumps on people, nips people, destroys things in the house. When it is \"working\" it is pulling her around, sniffing/scrounging for food on the floor in public areas, barking at other dogs.

      "Pixar and Disney combine to create accessible theatre experience. Hey all, there was an amazing event at Pixar last night and I was very lucky to be able to attend. Thought I would write up my experience for anyone interested.I ended up winning two raffle tickets to the event offered by the Lighthouse for the Blind in San Francisco. The event was called \"White Canes Red Carpet\" and was held at the main Pixar campus in Emeryville, CA. Several blind groups were in attendance, including the Lighthouse, CCB,Blind Babies, OCB, Lyons, and the CSFB. Prior to the event, we were instructed to download a beta application on our iDevices. Unfortunately, the install credentials were wrong and the Disney app team had to help everyone install it at the door.They actually laid out a 150' red carpet down the center of the Pixar atrium flanked by statues of characters from The Good Dinosaur, which was what we were there to experience. My girlfriend and I were a bit rushed in checking out everything offered to the crowd due to some transportation issues and arriving late along with the bottleneck of attendees who needed the app installed, and eventually they funnelled us all to the theatre.The app worked like a charm. The Good Dinosaur description was alreadt offered within the app,. Worked seamlessly with VoiceOver, and the information page for the movie had an audio description sync button that would  auto-sync to the movie by listening to the sound in the theatre via an active mic. We had the option of listening to description only, or have description mixed with the actual movie audio through our earbuds/headsets. The description only mode was much better, IMO. This basically allows you to control your own descriptive experience in theatres rather than relying on shoddy audio description units and incompetent projectionists/managers.Unfortunately, my battery drained almost 50% through the course of the movie on my iPhone 5S, but I gladly would prefer having to recharge my battery or carry a charge pack rather than having my sighted girlfriend have to miss out on the openings of movies when the stupid descriptive unit fails to work. The app had The Good Dinosaur preloaded for us, but was also populated with almost all of the Disney classic animations, other Pixar films, and Marvel and Star Wars properties. Conceivably, you would be able to sync up description at home when watching with others, and not have to worry about people with vision getting distracted or missing out on sound effects/music with the audio description on. Plus, this means that older movies released before audio description was available will now be able to get their own description tracks, opening up the world of Disney and Pixar animations to those of you were unfortunately not able to physically see them.Have not been able to test this functionality with any other movies so far, but I am greatly looking forward to it in the future! \n",

Some low tone loss in my right ear is now permanent and I have constant tinnitus. I can't understand if too many people are talking (usually more than one is a struggle) or if there's background noise. I'm constantly asking people to repeat themselves and straining to remain focused and understand what is being said. If I can't CC it I can't really watch it or I rewind a hundred times if I can't understand something until I know what was said or give up. (My mom also informed me that for a time when I was a toddler I seemed to be unable to hear her and she would have to touch my hand or shoulder for my attention then point at her mouth for me to lipread. But it eventually stopped and I started hearing again and she never brought it up.)So to prepare for the possibility that I'll continue losing my hearing I (as well as my parents and sibling) have jumped on learning ASL (though I'm having to just learn on my own at home because I'm medically disabled and can't afford to go take a class).My question is, do I belong here? Will I be accepted by the community? How should I be identifying myself? Do I still say I'm hearing? Or should I be identifying as HI or HoH?

Basically, audio is recorded on multiple tracks, then edited and mixed together. The best cinemas have 128 speakers, true surround sound, which is what sound editors mix for. For non-cinema releases, editors have to start combining tracks into 7, 5, 2, or 1 so that they are compatible with TV speakers, resulting in poorer sound quality. So even hearing people struggle to understand dialogue and need to turn on subs. This video could be another useful resource to combat the snobs who say subtitles and cc “ruin” the experience.

The hearing aids help with auditory cues, but I rely almost 100% on lipreading for communication (raised oral and not fluent in ASL). I definitely process some sounds, but speech is pretty much unintelligible for me. Never having been around kids much growing up, I only recently had the chance to try holding some babies. I was really alarmed to discover I had NO idea when they were crying or making a noise. Turns out babies are like constantly wiggling, gurgling, making sounds, and grunting and stuff. I found it nearly impossible to distinguish between sighing, cooing, fussing, and crying unless I was looking at the baby's face. It made me feel panicky (and also weird that I could be holding a crying baby and not know it was crying).How have other parents dealt with this? Do you come to know the \"feel\" of your own child's sounds? Do you just have to look at their face constantly to know what they're doing? I think I was prepared for having to adjust for things like visual baby monitors and whatever -- but I wasn't prepared to not be able to tell when the baby is fussing via touch.  \n",

He can't read lips or understand any of his students if they attempt to communicate with him through their voices.However, I've noticed that for certain signs he will partially speak the English equivalent of the word he is saying. For example, when he taught us the word HOW, he would say \"ow\", or for FIVE, he would say \"fah.\" When he is thinking aloud about something he will say \"hmmm,\" like a hearing person would.

      "in a medical setting, can/should an office provide an interpreter without asking first? I started working at a medical practice as a front desk receptionist. Some patients will have \"requires an interpreter\" listed on their account, and we work with an interpreting agency to get interpreters for appointments with Deaf and Hard of Hearing patients who request one. If a patient calls in on VRS, even if they're listed as requiring an interpreter, I still ask if they want one just in case. One time I asked a patient and they said they don't want one for their upcoming appointment, and I said that was fine and scheduled them. After scheduling the patient, my boss told me that in the future I shouldn't ask. They said it is a liability for us if there's a miscommunication or something goes wrong. They also said something about it possibly being illegal. In my mind, I was glad I asked because it turned out what was listed for them wasn't what the patient wanted for that appointment. I also think it's better to check in with the patient about it so they aren't surprised by an unneeded interpreter. \n",

They usually repeat it the second time though by the third forth or fifth time you can tell they're losing patience.Other times I just can't pronounce certain words very well and end up stammering a lot of the time.

It totally blew my mind one day when I accidentally mixed up my ear-buds and heard a completely different version of what I thought was a now familiar song. Now I know that a whole bunch of songs, some more than others, have completely different sound coming in to each ear, but you are meant to hear them both at the same time. Unfortunately I cannot do that, so instead I will settle for the next best thing by trying to listen through a mono output. Only problem is I have a crappy galaxy phone and it doesn't have a mono audio option under \"hearing\" in the accessibility options, in fact it doesn't have any accessibility options at all! However I wouldn't mind even if I can only listen to music from my phone from mono, so I've been looking for alternative music players with mono support for a while. Turns out they're a lot rarer than I though, especially if you're not looking to spend money. I did find this relatively unknown player and gave it a shot, it worked okay enough and had a mono output, but out of nowhere on the second day of using it the sound spiked in the middle of a song and I though I had lost what hearing I had left. Turns out this thing has some serious problems with volume control as it goes out of control for a split second every so often.

      "Identification canes- helpful or not? I'm vision impaired from an anoxic brain injury from a surgery in October 2014. My vision used in the few months directly after the surgery was much worse-diplopia, I was unable to read- but has improved a lot since. However, I am still significantly impaired.I was thinking an identification cane could be helpful. I can see cars and most curbs, but I occasionally trip over cracks in the sidewalk and I can't see if a driver is gesturing to me. I've slowly regained a lot of independence since my surgery, and I really don't want to get hit by a car and lose that independence or worse. Having an ID cane might help to communicate my vision impairment in a discreet way.It also could help when riding the bus or walking around a crowded place. I can usually see obstacles but if there's not much contrast  it's obviously harder.I'm a bit concerned of what people would assume about me too. Unless they've done research, most people probably don't know that there's different types of white canes. Would they assume I'm fully blind and try to be annoyingly overly helpful for my level of vision impairment ? Would people try to take advantage by, for example,not giving me the correct amount of change? Or worse, would I be vulnerable to attacks?

      "Looking for resources for making accessible software Currently I am working on a hobby software project, and as part of that project I am creating some graphical user interface controls from scratch. Making these controls accessible is proving to be no easy task, in part because it feels like the documentation I am working with is missing important pieces. Some of my problems are purely technical (where the documentation leaves some details unspecified), but where I really feel lost is understanding the unwritten conventions of how users will interact with what I create via screen-readers and other tools. It is one thing to provide the information according to the specifications, but I am often left wondering whether I am providing it in a way that is intuitive slash conventional. I know that sounds extremely vague, so let me try to give a concrete example. On my end of things, one of the pieces of information I am expected to provide for an editable text-box control is an abstract range of text that the accessibility software can ask to move backwards or forwards, either by characters or words or various other units. This sounds simple enough, but the problem is that I also support bidirectional text. This means text that is generally presented in the left to right direction, but which may have some words or phrases embedded in it that are presented in a right to left direction (embedded Arabic or Hebrew, for example). The problem is that the internal order in which the text is stored is not the same as the visual order in which it appears on the screen. So I am left unsure whether I should make the ranges I am providing move through the text in the order in which it is stored, which might make it easier to read, or in the order in which it is presented, which might make it easier to edit. But that is just one example. I am not looking for just answers to that specific question, what I am looking for is a forum or some other venue where I can ask questions of people who have experience with the technical side of things when it comes to making software accessible. Any ideas? \n",

      "Would I be considered HoH? Very new to this, sorry if I get something wrong or post this the wrong way or if this sort of thing isn't allowed, though I didn't find a rule saying this isn't an appropriate question.So, to start this: I can hardly hear out of my right ear, it's been that way for quite a while.The \"why\" of it is the reason I'm asking. I went to the doctor about 3 years ago with hearing loss, and found out i had an obstruction of ear wax. No biggie, he removed it an i could hear fine again. But then it happened again, and again, and again. Nothing would work to clear it other than having the doctor manually remove it manually, and nothing will prevent it. Found out my ear is too small, and doesn't release ear wax naturally, and it was triggered with a mild case of swimmers ear.I haven't been to the doctor to get it cleared in a while now, about a year and a half. Its really painful to get it pulled out every 2 weeks, and it drains well enough that it won't cause harm, but everything sounds like i have ear plugs in and it's caused really bad tinnitus that makes the sounds that *do* make it though unintelligible. Would I be considered HoH, despite the fact that it's my own decision to leave it that way? Or would I just be considered as having a temporary obstruction? \n",

I got it a few days before Christmas, so I could try it out. The first one-two days were just fine. Then, my floaters flared up and worsened when I looked at the screen.For context, I have 20/400 with no periferal vision in my left eye, light perception in the right. The floaters were harmless, but it just seemed strange that they'd just go nuts like that. Now...Aunt Flow was coming to visit that week, so maybe the hormones going nuts could have caused that.I packed the TV back up and returned it and went back to my 24-inch monitor. The floaters slowly calmed down and have been gone since. My mom thought the TV was too big for my limited vision. I'm tempted to think the same, but part of me thought that was just a coincidence or, like I said, hormones going nuts.I want to try again, but I can't decide between getting a smaller TVor an all in one pc. The former will be a bit tricky, since 4K has become so prevalent, and TVs under 32 inches usually don't have that resolution. The latter could work, but AIOs are much harder to fix, and I heard they're not too great for gaming.Thoughts/suggestions? \n",

Naturally, as a TWC customer in Rochester, NY, I'm very concerned about the Comcast/TWC merger going through... mainly because that VP usage can easily push us way past that cap. That would result in atrocious increases in our monthly bills. (The fact that our teenage son games online heavily doesn't help matters much).So, my fellow deaf brothers and sisters who live in these areas covered by Comcast throughout the states (the ones with caps in place), how has this affected you? If yes, are there legal issues that you can or have talked to your lawyers about when it comes to discrimination? A couple of years ago, TWC tried to implement a cap on data usage in my city, but backed off quickly due to protests of anger among customers (and our Deaf/HoH community played a huge part in this - threatening legal action on grounds of discrimination related to VP/VRS usage, or at least according to rumors.)Many thanks in advance for your input, guys! \n",

      "Unilateral Hearing Loss Hello /r/deaf/... I rarely turn to the Internet of Friends for medical advice but I feel like the doctors are giving my daughter the run around. She's almost 8 now and has been hard of hearing on one side of her head since she was a baby. It seems to be getting worse and the doctors recently performed an outpatient surgery to put tubes. There was no evidence of fluid buildup in the ear before the surgery but they said they wanted to rule out the possibility that there is an obstruction. They found no such obstruction or obvious sign of hearing loss. The audiologist shrugs just as the doctors do - however they recommend a trial with a CROS hearing aid. I'm wondering if any of you all have used such a device. Can you explain how it's helped you? What the approximate cost was? Our insurance doesn't cover hearing aids or hearing tests (but covers Viagra...what?!?) so this is all out of pocket for me. I don't have a lot of faith that the doctors will be able to determine the cause of her hearing loss. Was this your experience too if you were suffering unilateral hearing loss? Or is it time for a new doctor? Can you recommend an ENT/audiologist in the Los Angeles area?

      "You know what we need? Traffic/driving/transit reform. My friends and family often hear me joke about how even I can tell people are crappy drivers, but I'm beginning to get more and more concerned about driving, roadways, and traffic problems. For fun, I came up with a wish-list of things I think would be good ideas for transit systems across the US, and maybe other countries as well. Feel free to weigh in with your thoughts. 1: harsher penalties for speeding. This one is self explanatory, mostly, but it comes from the fact that I hear so much about how people have to speed to keep in line with other traffic, or they don't feel safe. This is stupid, IMO, and if people can't follow the rules, they shouldn't be allowed to drive the most dangerous machinery that everyone has access to.2: Everyone retakes the test every 2 years. I know the DMV is a place where souls go to die, but if people had to go through all the tests every two years, the number of poor drivers should decrease because they're getting up-to-date training every two years. 3: Mandatory statewide day-to-day transit services for people with disabilities. I can get to a doctor appointment just fine though my medicaid, but the grocery store, bank, and a job are more difficult to get to, and that's dumb. 4: More incentives for carpooling/mass transit. A special lane that people abuse anyway isn't enough, especially since that lane isn't available everywhere.5: Civilians should be able to use their phones to record a speeding or unsafe driver and give that information to law enforcement efficiently. I can't tell you how many times I've almost been hit by people not observing white cane laws, and I want those people to understand how unfair it is that I have almost no recourse.6: self-driving vehicles should be incentivized. Companies should get more grants from the Dept of Transit, owners should get tax breaks/credits.7: More on autonomous vehicles: We need a new class of driver's license; Non-qualified operator license. This license would be given to someone who owns an autonomous vehicle, but can't operate a non-autonomous one for some reason, either because they have a disability or chose not to. If there's an accident, non-qualified operators can't be at fault unless they actively screwed up somehow. 8: Disabled owners of autonomous vehicles should have their auto-insurance be part of their medicaid. 9: in general, more strict driving tests, and getting a traffic ticket should mean automatic retraining that the driver has to pay for. Dept of Transit can use increase in funding to help pay for aforementioned medicaid-auto insurance and other stuff.10: using a cell phone while driving is a primary infraction, and hands-free calling setups of any kind are no exception. Any use of cell phones while traveling more than 10mph results in a ticket.like I said, this is more of a wish-list than anything, but I'm pretty sure if driving were more regulated, it wouldn't kill as many people every year. \n",

Like she can only see light and blurry colors and stuff. She has to use a cane and gets bullied a lot for that. People are always messing with her, hiding her stuff etc.So our guidance counselor asked me to be her \"reading buddy.\" I read to her every Friday at lunch and we study together or just hang out. At first the situation was pretty awkward and embarrassing for both of us, but now that I've gotten to know her, I actually really like her. She gives me a lot of compliments and tells me she loves my voice and stuff so I think she has a crush on me too. I've been thinking about asking her out soon.Even though we've hung out at least once every week for the last few months, I really don't know that much about her condition or how it effects her life. I just know a few things that she's casually told me. It seems like she gets depressed when she thinks about it and she does get bullied for it so I hate bringing that topic up. I try to just treat her normally since a lot of people seem weird about her lack of eyesight.I should also say that this would be both of our first relationships, so that's always awkward no matter what.Any advice?

Top of the head? Mouth? Nose perhaps? Chest? My assumption is that you will still answer the same, but because of hearing, and you \"exist\" at the center between your eardrums, which coincidentally is still behind your nose bridge.What are your thoughts on this? \n",

When we visit him he often tries to tell us things by writing letters in the air, but it's really difficult to communicate with him. He currently can't write on a paper.Do you have an idea?

      "\"Never mind\" is bad enough... how about when you say \"what?\" and they repeat ONE SOLITARY WORD and expect you to magically put it together? So this afternoon, my young son was asking about this new soup he wanted to try, which is sold at the deli at Whole Foods or something.He is the pickiest eater on earth, I call him The Anteater because he eats like one thing consistently. So it would never occur to me that he was talking about trying a new food. Let alone soup, which is wet and unwieldy, and would require him to actually sit down and pay attention while eating, also not his favourite thing.Plus, there was a lot of background noise AND he wanted to leave the room so he kept twisting away from me... I mean the chances of me \"guessistening\" this sentence are nil. But to make it worse, every time he repeats it he leaves out more and more words until he finally yells \"Soup! I'm saying soup!\"Buddy. My dude. Your homework tonight was literally about what constitutes a sentence. Where's the subject? Where's the verb?And _then_ he hit me with the \"never mind\" and walked out. I'm so mature, I yelled \"NO SOUP FOR YOU!\" after him.We'll have a few extra hours of ASL practice this week. >;-)(His sister, _after_ this whole exchange, speaks up and says that he was asking if he could try the soup from the deli at the store.

Just got an email from the DOJ that essentially they get too many submissions for cases they can't take action on all of them. They've decided this is one they won't take action on. Further on it said that reports though help them find issues that affect multiple people and whole communities for them to take action on.So I guess according to the DOJ we aren't a community. We aren't a large enough group to matter. Braille and access for the blind and visually impaired is not important.

For example, the Deaf community tends to be really against the phrase “hearing impaired” and Deaf people often prefer to just be called Deaf. Also, many Deaf people capitalize the D in the word Deaf to recognize Deaf culture and history. This is not the case for all of us, but this is the case for a large fraction of us.In short, I am curious about the terms you guys tend to gravitate towards to refer to yourselves.

Does the dog stand outside your individual stall or outside the bathroom altogether? I’m so curious. Of course, if you have someone with you, presumably they can stay with the dog if you’re able to go to the bathroom without assistance. I’m thinking specifically if you go to a public restroom when it’s just you and your dog, and it’s not a single stall bathroom, it’s multiple stalls.

      "How can I improve software user-interfaces to be more conducive to those who are visually impaired? Hi everyone. I'm a front-end engineer at a software company, and I'm working with a team of four to put together the user interface. I've been exploring ARIA and testing the web with Apple's onboard VoiceOver software.The problem I'm running into is, I'm not exactly sure how people use VoiceOver. For example, in my first iteration of the user interface, I coded things so that when an individual pressed tab through the page, it would automatically read all content relevant to those with a screen reader.Then I pressed control, option \"A\", and the screen reader began to read certain parts over twice. So basically the screen reader read everything I told it to read with ARIA, then it read everything again, this time without so it didn't have the same context.I find that the benefit of ARIA is I can add context to a page that may not make a whole lot of sense otherwise. But what I'm concerned about is that maybe people tend to use control, option \"A\" over using tab, which would render my ARIA efforts useless, and the screen reader would just be redundant. That would make the overall user experience pretty bad.What is your protocol for browsing websites? Control, option \"A\", or tab? Are there things you find particularly frustrating when browsing, where ARIA might just be overkill?  \n",

      "Fears of non-acceptance vs. future-proofing I am mostly blind in my right eye, and until now have been extremely grateful that my “spare” severely myopic eyeball is 20/20 with very strong correction. This weekend I had flashes and floaters in the good eye, so I went to the ER fearing a retinal detachment. I was born with a cataract and other issues in my right eye, which made me at higher risk of retinal detachment. At 22 I had a massive retinal detachment that almost caused me to lose my right eye. All of the scar tissue from years of surgeries caused glaucoma, and about every 5 years something goes wrong that means I need another surprise surgery even though I take good care of my health. My left eye used to have a healthy retina, but now it has peripheral lattice degeneration and a vitreous detachment placing traction on the macula. It could be totally fine forever, but with my history, these new discoveries are freaking me out. I’m a professional artist, and if I cannot see anymore it will be devastating. I’m trying not to catastrophize something that hasn’t happened yet, but it’s a struggle. I want to be proactive and learn adaptive skills before I need them, but I also feel like that’s frowned upon. I’m not disabled enough to be considered disabled, and I’m worried that learning to use a cane as a person who can still see with correction will draw criticism or trivialize the needs of people who 100% rely on mobility aids. I’m in need of support and guidance from people who understand what I’m going through, but I don’t know anyone locally. Any insights or resources are appreciated. \n",

I have a whole list of activities that I tend to do in these states, basically comes down to YouTube, animated TV shows, and audiobooks -- all on my phone. The problem is, of course, I'll get eye fatigue from this regardless because I can't see very well at all (legally blind in one of the eyes and meh in the other), and I'll end up falling asleep super, super early.I've tried a couple of things -- getting off my couch and into a chair, listening to peppy music, etc.. But, I don't know, it's hard to focus on these external changes when my internal is saying SLEEPY IRRITATED EYES.Does anyone else deal with this?

I have been wearing mine (e.g., 380P since the mid 1990s since I have a few old ones in my storages) and noticed they only seem to last about 3-5 years before having problems (e.g., latest issue is its light brown Oticon BC462 100 bone conduction oscillator part seems to make distortions, changes volume by itself, etc. compared to my very old dark brown one with only \"DENMARK\" label (no numbers and Oticon labels) -- did Oticon go cheap on its parts if they are different inside [did not open]?). I wore and used mine daily (power on/off, volume control, etc. a lot). Sometimes I sleep with it because I passed out. Oops.

We make the same sounds hearing people make during any activity, and the best way to talk with a deaf person is to ask the deaf or hearing impaired person his or her preference. Not all of us sign and some of us are spotty on lip reading without our hearing aids. Whatever you do, don't yell at a deaf person with hearing aids. It hurts our ears and it pisses me off. Look at us straight in the eye and talk normally. No exaggerated lip movements, please.  That question about how it feels to lose one's hearing is really awful. What do you think?  It stinks like it does to go bald or to need stronger glasses. But it is not the end of the world and there are work arounds, such as texting or chatting instead of calling, using a speaker phone if you have to call, or asking a hearing person to place the call with you on a speaker phone. There also are relay services.  And email.We are not that different from hearing people other than we have trouble hearing! \n",

After further discussion with the community, our final policy is [here](  Hello:As I've gotten complaints from people who have attempted to purchase the game in [this post]( only to find that the Steam store is totally inaccessible with there screen-reader and they can't get a refund, we're now blocking all links to steampowered.com on /r/blind.  While we still have no rule against inaccessible content, and we welcome discussion of steam games as self-posts, I do think it's important to try and protect folks from spending money on games they will never be able to play.  If you do need to link to steampowered.com, moderators may still approve the post if the post title clearly indicates the steam store is not accessible, or if there is some other reason why you want to link to steampowered.  However, I believe that selling blind people games they cannot play due to flaws in Steam is false advertising, and I cannot in good conscience continue to allow it.  This new policy is something I came up with extremely quickly.  If people are unhappy with it, I am open to discussion of change.  However, we do need a way to mark that while Steam games may be accessible to some blind and low vision individuals, those using screen-readers should think twice before making a purchase. \n",

I had thought about choosing ISL teaching but then a Deaf mentor of mine mentioned that the Deaf community might not welcome a hearing ISL teacher. Reasons like Signing skill, lack of Deaf Culture and Background (i have only 3 and a half years of experience with the Deaf community) and some concerns that hearing people would be taking 'Deaf jobs'.So although i didn't choose ISL teaching this topic had always interested me and i decided to base my thesis on it. After doing some research i had found that this type of question has never really been asked before so i figured i'd start.*Whats your opinion on hearing Sign language teachers?*Do you think hearing teachers will affect the language?*Do you think hearing teachers are taking jobs from Deaf people?*Are hearing people culturally able to teach Sign Language?*Or is this something you guys just don't care about? \n",

      "User managed hearing aids Hey folks - Sorry if this doesn't fit within this subreddit. Bit of a back story along with a question.Two years ago I was diagnosed with otosclerosis in my left ear after having diminished hearing for several years (90% loss now) along with super annoying tinnitus, as well as above average loss of hearing in my right ear. I'm in the UK, so I'm very thankful that I was provided with a hearing aid for my left ear, albeit it did take a year to receive it! I lost my hearing aid on a train at the weekend there. I was wearing headphones, stuck the hearing aid in my pocket as I was going to be using it again shortly and got off of the train to find that I no longer had it in my pocket. Fantastic! I've contacted all of the train stations I visited, along with the lost and found departments, but I'm afraid it's a goner.I've contacted the audiology department at my hospital and I've been told that I need to wait till October for an appointment - who knows when I'll actually be able to receive a new hearing aid. Again - very grateful for the NHS.Now to the question: Does anyone have a hearing aid that they are able to tune to their requirements themselves or know of a specific model? I'm looking down the route to buy my own that has more features, that also allows me to configure to match my hearing loss. The tinnitus is driving me wild (both pulsative and your standard screamy type). When wearing an aid, it kinda dulls it out a bit. I've looked into white noise helping with tinnitus, but unfortunately don't have the opportunity to use anything at work. \n",

      "I'm helping my blind friend financially get a mobility coach to prepare for getting a guide dog. What should I consider? Hi, my fraternity raised a sum of money to help a blind student on our campus pay for the related expenses of owning a guide dog. He has been able to get a guide dog twice now, but both times had to return the dog to the respective school just a few weeks after completing training because he has had issues navigating with the dog safely on a busy college campus.The CA dept of rehab is no longer going to pay for my friend's mobility coach sessions and we are considering dipping into the money we raised for the guide dog to pay for his mobility sessions. The rate will be $170 for each two-hour session and the instructor recommends 6 sessions. Does this sound reasonable to all of you? My friend became blind from a car accident and still suffers from PTSD and difficulty with spatial awareness. \n",

      "Non-deaf person with a question about induction loop system. I don't have hearing problems, as such, but I do have PTSD. It does mean that I have auditory disturbances at times, but mostly it means that my hearing is like Superman's super hearing turned up to 11. Sounds don't blend into the background so that I can tune them out, everything comes at me at full strength and it's often totally overwhelming.I've become very isolated as a result, and my only pleasure is to go to the cinema, but I have been slowly losing even this. I go to early shows when the cinema is likely to be less busy and I can get lost in the film. As the cinema is such an immersive experience I can get lost in the story and it brings me some relief from the constant stress I live with. However, the slightest whisper from anyone else jolts me out of the immersion. As I have an exaggerated startle response, any unexpected noise causes me considerable alarm and distress. After a few difficult experiences I have stopped going to the cinema as my symptoms have worsened recently.My question is this : would using the induction loop at the cinema help in any way? I know my cinema provides equipment, but I don't know what that means in practice. Does one need a hearing aid to use it? Would it help me isolate the soundtrack from ambient sounds in the auditorium?I know that this might sound like a strange question to ask, and I hope nobody minds me asking it. The PTSD has many distressing symptoms and is very hard to live with. If there was any chance to resume an activity that gives me some respite I'd really like to do it. \n",

She's also cross-eyed so it's noticeable to people (and because she needs to be an inch or two away from her phone to be able to surf it).So far the main challenges I can think of is that she can't drive (so I drive us everywhere / we just need to take breaks during road trips). She's generally a bit more clumsy (self-admitted) which from our activities together just seem to be that she trips more during hikes (not fall down tripping, but stumbles over tree branches or rocks). Maybe a little worse at cleaning duties (making sure all the dust is off the floor).But other than those, she has a white collar office job (from her experience she does note that potential employers seem to have their doors closed due to her visual impairment), a masters degree, pays her own bills, and seems to be able to go places herself (with the use of public transit or uber). I sometimes worry for her about crossing the street, but she says she goes parallel traffic (is that almost fail proof?).I keep reading posts and hear from people how it is really hard to be long-term with someone who is blind. Or it's \"a lot harder than I expected, but kudos to you\". The only next thing I can think of is if we have children. Will that be a major difficulty in terms of taking care of them? Because other than that, these 3+ years haven't seemed all that hard actually. We video call, we play video games, we watch TV, we go kayaking, hiking, road trips, international travels, etc. I just have a tendency of holding her hand more often or reading out signs or menus to her.

      "How do you overcome the challenges of ordering food on mobile apps? Hi, I'm an aspiring UX Designer working on my design portfolio. I'm currently working on a project for a restaurant's mobile ordering app (think Starbucks or McDonald's app). I was checking out the UberEats app to get ideas on things that I can improve on for my own app design. One thing I noticed was that a lot of the names for the menu items were either too vague or just straight-up random words strung together. If you click on an item, depending on the restaurant, you'll most likely get a picture of the dish, but you will rarely get a description of it. There's no information on how the food is prepared, possible allergens, or any standout ingredients. At that moment I thought, \"Well, at least they have pictures of what the food looks like; I can use that to decide if I want to try it or not.\"I then quickly realized that this design isn't very accessible to a lot of people, especially to those who are blind or visually impaired.This leads me to the reason I'm posting on here: in what ways do you overcome the challenges of ordering food online when all a restaurant offers are pictures and no description for food menu items?

He works as a cyber security penetration tester and already has some ideas on what areas he can pivot into as his sight gets worse. But he’s depressed and moody, understandably so. I’d like to support him but I’m not certain how best to do that. Right now I listen to him, help him problem solve if he wants to do that, take him anywhere he wants to go, basically I’m letting him figure it out himself and tell me what he wants/needs. I’m not sure what else to do. At first I would research support groups etc. for RP, told him about Reddit groups like this one because I figured other people in a similar place could offer him support and ideas on how to adapt. He seemed to hate my doing that so I stopped. Honestly, I think what he most wants from me is to pretend it isn’t happening except in the areas he requires my help. Even then, I can tell he hates needing help. He had high hopes for his low vision specialist appointment, but some of the options for independence he won’t consider learning yet. He especially hates the idea of the cane or a dog. What can I do to support him and make this change easier for him? I think he’s mostly in grief and denial at this point, so I just listen and try to comfort him. I really don’t know what else to do. Any advice would be much appreciated. \n",

      "Wearing HAs consistently I’ve had HAs ever since I was like 4 or 5 (aka 1985).  I’ve never worn them consistently like I should have, due to emotional abuse & gaslighting from family, & years of bullying at school.  I stopped wearing it in middle school, & didn’t wear any again until my early thirties, as my slowly progressive loss worsened.  Even then, I still didn’t wear them like I should’ve.  Since then, my hearing has gone down to basically profound loss, & I went through three different sets of BTEs, & have had Phonak Naida UPs with Roger mics (necessities for when out, or watching telley (with captions, of course).My question is more psychological in nature, I suppose.  When I do sincerely try to wear them for days, I’ll often get a day or two, but then stop, & I can’t figure out why.  They obviously help me… & my ex asked me why it seemed I use something that I get enthusiastic about for short periods of time, but then almost become, “afraid,” of using, & stop wearing them.  Has anyone else ever felt even something remotely similar???  I do hate that about myself, & I do want to wear them, because I know my deaf arse needs them… \n",

I'm completely deaf in my left ear, and have been since age 2 or 3 (I am now 27), and it is incredibly frustrating for me that no one seems to understand quite how difficult it is for me to hear in crowds or when multiple people start talking at once.My family in particular are often very unhelpful with this; they choose restaurants that are quite noisy, and I often get an eyeroll if I request the leftmost seat at the table so that I can hear better. My younger sister once got really annoyed and exclaimed, \"wow you really milk this whole 'deaf' thing.\"My dad in particular is *awful* about talking over other people. It's rude in an of itself, but when I'm trying to listen to the other person, it makes hearing them almost impossible because I can't just \"tune in\" to one of the sounds while tuning out the rest. He got very angry with me recently on a family trip, because I became frustrated and asked him to stop talking, just for a moment, so that my mom could finish responding to a question I had asked (I had asked it repeatedly, but when she would answer, he would begin talking over her to try and answer my question). I explained that it made it hard to hear, but he just threw his hands in the air, stomped away, and refused to talk to me for the rest of the night.I remembered recently that when I was in elementary school, we had a deaf student join the class, and her mom brought in a video explaining how her hearing aids worked and what things sounded like to her with them...I just wondered if there was any kind of thing like that that could help explain to people with full hearing what it's like to have monaural hearing? \n",

I got a CI later in life solely for the purpose of environmental cues. I've had profound hearing loss since birth and haven't heard anything less than 80dB in over 20 years so I never really had any hope of learning to comprehend language. An evaluation showed regular hearing aids wouldn't help so I got the CI and I guess I just kind of use it as a fancy hearing aid.

Deaf friends don't care one way or another, obviously.

I don't know, I guess what I'm asking is if this is a normal part of the process. I tried to stand up for myself and explain it's really hard just getting used to being exposed to sound at all, it's not fair to expect me to learn to hear when so few of my hearing friends/family haven't made a real effort to learn to sign, and to my credit I've come a very long way in my progress, so if I don't wear it for 24-48 hours it's because I need a respite, not because I am being lazy.

      "Looking for advice on large gatherings Hi. To start off, I have APD (auditory processing disorder), so my hearing issues are in my brain not my ears. But I still think this sub can help since I encounter many of the same problems as those who are HoH when there's background noise. Some more background: When there's a lot of background noise, my APD makes it nearly impossible to distinguish speech from noise. I just got diagnosed this year, and I'm learning to lipread, but it's a slow process (and as y'all know, lipreading is far from perfect). I'm managing fairly well in work and small social situations. My question today is about how to handle larger gatherings, especially when I'm around a lot of people I don't know. A friend of mine took me to his fire hall banquet today, and it was the first of that type of event I've been to since getting the brain injury that caused my APD. I was totally unprepared for how lost I would be, conversation-wise, even with my friend's help.This isn't something that could be solved with my friend repeating to me what everyone was saying--I couldn't even catch most of what he said, and that's with the aid of lipreading. Neither of us signs (I'm learning slowly, but the only people I'm asking to learn some signs/fingerspelling are my close friends who I interact with regularly).So basically I'm asking for advice on how to cope being in situations like this, where I'm unable to follow or participate in most conversations. My instinct is to retreat to my phone and text or reddit, but I know that's so not what to do. I enjoy the food, and getting dressed up, and the atmosphere, so I don't wanna stop going to these types of events. But it's so frustrating not being able to participate in conversation.

I also got bullied pretty hard for it as the only kid with vision issues at school. Once I put the cane away, I got more respect. I grew to disdain my cane even as I continued O&M despite my protests.Fast forward. I am 21 and I don't use my cane at all. The university I go to has tons of bikes and everyone bikes around without paying attention, with headphones, or at night without a light. I've nearly gotten run over several times, because I can't see them. Fact is that using my cane would make it a lot easier. There are 2 problems: First is that I'm still terrified of using my cane without getting talked down to. Second is that my major is chemistry. Some people in the department are nervous about someone with low vision handling chemicals. I have handled some pretty dangerous chemicals, like sodium ethoxide and hydrochloric acid, with few errors. I am capable, but I don't want me using a cane to make me lose internships and research opportunities.In short, how can I get over my fear of using my cane? (A friend once called it cane-phobia) \n",

      "[Advise] Toddler Son's Hearing I am hoping to find people that can relate with my situation and also have either experienced it themselves whether they were a child with hearing impairment, or a parent.My son is 15 months old and has had chronic ear and sinus infections since he was 5 months old. Two months ago he had tubes placed in his ears as well as his adenoids removed. Initially we saw most, if not all his symptoms improve. But within a month he had another ear infection and his audiology screening did not show any improvement from his initial test.  I am more concerned about his day to day symptoms as they have seem to vastly worsen. -His speech is not up to par with his other daycare same aged classmates and heavily relies on his baby signing-He grabs his side of head often and even smack his ears or tugs at them-Usually will not respond or listen to people if not in eyesight. -His balance seems to be off and usually cannot walk in a straight line, whereas he used to be able to.-He is inconsolable and irritable especially without loud background noise.*Additionally, his caregivers at daycare have mentioned that he likes to watch the other kids play and observes and mimics them. I am getting very frustrated that I cannot help him and can't seem to get his ENT specialist to be on the same page with me.I am curious if other parents have experienced this things and if so, what did you do to ease to situation. \n",

      "[USA] Update to my last post about seeing new eye doctor Saw new eye doctor today, this is the second visit. He wanted to do an OCT-A test to check for blood flow. Also, sat in front of a couple other cameras, one of which had flash bulbs (that sucked since I'm photo-sensitive)Ater the tests were done, doctor said blood flow looked decent enough. Although, he did notice some capillaries missing from macula. His primary focus right now is to reduce the macular edema in the left eye. After some deliberation, I opted to hold off until my next visit for my first shot of Avastin (I'll have to ask them about that as it seems to be a cancer drug and can make bleeding easier). It's the only eye injection my insurance approved, if it's the same drug.After getting home, I finally got access to my records and noticed a new DX added: nuclear sclerosis for both eyes. Sounds worse than it is. Basically, it's the precursor to cataracts found in older patients (I'm 40) and almost everyone gets it at some point in their life, even animals get it. There isn't a treatment available for that, not until it becomes full-blown cataracts. After reading about NS, I now understand why I see the way I do and why I have photophobia.Anyways, aside from eye injections, it seems like my treatment options are still very limited. If Avastin is the shot they can do, I'm not sure I want to use it if it can make bleeding easier. I've already been through 3 major bleeds within the last 3 years. Sounds like I have fun times ahead, lol! \n",

I see the ophthalmologists AGAIN on Monday. They ran hella blood tests on me. So many blood tests that to my embarrassment, for the first time in my life of giving blood every 3 months, I actually mumbled \"I dunno feel so good.\" Turns out they were taking that much blood, wow.Besides running literally over 2 dozen tests on me, they told me they wanna put me on methotrexate: I turned it down flat because I drink. I drink way too much as coping mechanism and I know that's a bad drug for me because my best friend was on it the last 2 months and 20 days of her life while I cared for her daily. They suggested another drug that I can't recall the name of but know the side effects for: decreases your red cell count in your bone marrow and renders you prone to blood cancers. What both drugs have in common is that they destroy your immune system and they're typically given to chemo patients.But the thing is, AZOOR is something they don't know much about if at all... so I feel like a fucking guinea pig that they're throwing darts at in hopes that something might stick.So my choices are: let them experiment on me and I catch every virus or get cancer and die... or I just eventually go fully blind. I really don't know what my remaining sight is worth to me. But I know I'd rather hold grandbabies in (hopefully no less than) 10 years from now and be alive to do it?Honestly,. I'm genuinely, actually scared about the side effects and was hoping a fellow AZOOR unicorn or immunodeficient person could chime in on this.Sorry to get al serious for once, y'all. \n",

      "[USA] Saw new eye doctor about 2 weeks ago, getting an OCT-A test come Monday I've been with Grene Vision for the last 3 years when things went south and I got my retinopathy diagnosis. Fast forward to last month and I'm leaving Grene Vision. The 2 locations in my area are so overbooked, they keep you waiting for 3 hours even when the lobby isn't half full.Anyways, this last time I went there, they had a new tech I saw first, they asked me all the new intake questions and kept commenting on how long it's been since my last visit. I go between 2 locations and I was at the other location the time before. So, finding out the 2 locations don't really talk to each other bothered me. Anyways, I got done with them and waited in another lobby waiting to see my doctor. That took another hour or so. Got called into a room and shortly after, my doctor was rushing through her script, quickly looked over both eyes, grabbed her other head-worn light thingy and then laid out some options all the while their tech was rambling through some abbreviations I didn't know. I opted for a surface steroid injection to help deal with the macular edema in my left eye. They get done with that about 10 minutes later and as she's backing out the door, she's asking if I have any other questions and poof, they're gone.Total visit took 3+ hours and is a PITA to get to since I live in another town. I decided to try another office and get a second opinion with my eyes and see if they were worth switching to. I felt bad info dumping everything to the tech and Dr, but I've had a lot happen in the past 3 years. Also found out the steroid shot I got was useless and mostly ineffective, which pissed me off cause Grene Vision sent me a bill saying I owe $350 for the \"procedure\" (I plan on fighting this next week). So, towards the end of the visit with the new doctor, they asked if I had a dye angiogram done. I told them the other office tried, but had lots of trouble finding a vein to inject into. They checked over my hands and said they have a non-invasive way of seeing the same thing with an OCT-A. So, that's what I'm having done next Monday.I really wanted to tough out Grene Vision, but their overall service has really gone downhill over the past year or so. Seems like they have a revolving door for employees and willingly overbook themselves and schedule patients when the doctor is off performing surgery elsewhere. I'm hoping this OCT-A will shed some more light on my good eye, but I fear they're going to find the blood flow isn't as good as they want it to be. The new Dr wants this test done prior to starting shots, which I'm not sure about getting mainly due to the cost and the existing bill I have with Grene Vision.Anyone else having issues with Grene Vision or had an OCT-A before? Anything I should expect from it? \n",

      "Tips for not losing motivation? Hi there, just to preface I'm 19 years old and diagnosed with myopic degeneration. Although my sight isn't terrible, every day when I see the weird patches in my centre vision it causes me to become extremely depressed and anxious, and I get horribly demotivating thoughts. My dream is to go to university, which I know I can do. The only thing is I need some high school credits and I just can't seem to get the motivation to work on anything when I constantly am facing these disturbances in my vision. I have quite a bit of floaters in each eye and they're very distracting too. I'm just wandering how people seem to overcome these challenges.Thanks! \n",

      "Jaws questions I’m learning how to use Jaws because I have to. I’ve hated the thing since it got shoved in my face with no training in 2013 and I got yelled at because I didn’t know how to go into forms mode. Actually, I have so many questions it would take a book and a half to list them all. My big one is this, how do I make it shut up? I want to know what letters and words I’m typing, but I think I know where the enter key is, and the tab key, and the old key, and basically every other key on the keyboard. I don’t need that information. Is there a way I can shut it up before I throw something at it? Also, is there a screen curtain equivalent so people can’t look over my shoulder? That makes me insanely uncomfortable. \n",

      "Imagine this I had a random thought today.Imagine that someone who either grew up oral and learned ASL during college or grew up in total communication, and becomes an involved activist for the Deaf Community. They decided that for publicized interviews, speeches, talk shows, etc, instead of talking and letting a interpreter do the signing, they will do the signing themselves even though they can speak nearly as well as the average hearing person. And it's not just to make it easier for the Deaf to understand her and feel more connected. The person would refuse to use their voice and take off their CIs before going up to sign. Whether it's them or the company that is speaking with the person paying for the interpreters could vary but let's pretend the person makes the companies pay. And if they refuse to provide one (saying \"you can talk and hear. What's the point?\"), the Deaf person would only sign (and occasionally write on a notepad), leaving hearing audiences and the people whom they agreed to talk to with in the dark of what the person is saying.All this to to give hearing people a idea of what it feels to have your time and money wasted just because people thought it wasn't worth their time making things accessible and to state that even ifI can imagine this would be somewhat controversial and it can make people not want to work with the person, making it a little harder to create a more accessible future.

Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit...I don't know where else to put it.My hearing test came back normal. Great, even. He thinks my hearing is TOO good (though my right ear is better than my left), that I should continue to lip read, and try to put myself in situations/locations where it will be easier for me to understand what's being said. I kind of feel like I'm making everything up, now. He did say that my..E..P...whatever it's called, what I requested him to turn the volume up to, was unusually high, which was odd (\"Maybe you just like things loud.\") But I passed the word-reading test fine, and heard all the beeps. But I was in a tiny, quiet room...with headphones on...that's not a realistic situation...My friend says he should have done more testing, and that I should get a 2nd opinion.If I'm in a group conversation, it's extremely hard for me to follow what's going on. Unless someone is on my right side, I need to be facing them so I can read their lips. I catch some words, then try to piece together what I thought they said, usually by elimination of what sounds right and what sounds foolish, body language, facial expression. I can't understand when people talk to me on the phone, or if someone's in the next room. People with accents are SO hard to understand. I mishear words all the time. Mishearing one word can change the entire context of the conversation, which is especially difficult because that entire sentence I just heard is suddenly invalid and I need to rethink about what you MIGHT have said, now that I know you're talking about a dog and not fog, etc. If someone's walking in front of me, or talking with their head turned away from me, or in the car, I can't make out what they're saying. I constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. If I have a fan on, or the AC kicks on, I can't hear people or the TV (I started using subtitles to help with this). I avoid social situations or tune out of conversations if nothing I do helps me hear them, because it gets tiring struggling to understand them, staring at each other during that awkward pause where it's my turn to talk, and then answering incorrectly (\"...that wasn't a yes or no question.\") I can HEAR people, but I miss about 60-70% of the WORDS they say. It sounds like mumbling. I also do get occasional ringing in the ear, that fades and I lose almost all hearing for a few minutes, and \"fullness\" of the ear.I feel like I'm making things up. What happens if I get a 2nd opinion and the tests come back normal again??  I feel kind of bummed out. \n",

      "Am I visually impaired? Hello! I'm having a hard time knowing how to refer to my eyesight issues. I wondered if what I have counts as a visual impairment, so I googled it.However, the definitions I've found mostly mention vision loss or having a smaller field of vision, and nothing about the issues I have.I have constant double vision, and thus also no depth perception. I've had surgeries to try to correct it and I also wear glasses to help correct it. This all helpes to a degree, but not fully. I'm less likely to get a headache from my eyes and I do have an easier time seeing, but my vision is still double and the depth perception still isn't there.I am able to read, but not for very long before I get a headache and my eyes become really tired. No one has technically told me that I'm not allowed to drive, but I personally don't feel like it's safe for me to do so, so I refuse.Other than that I don't encounter things I can't do because of my eyesight in my day to day life very often, I just need to do things a bit differently. However, sometimes I do encounter things I'm not able to do because of my eyesight, or things that are made much more difficult because of it.I usually don't have mobility issues except for in especially steep or otherwise unusual stairs, or if I go hiking where the ground is very uneven. Oh and walking into things at times or missing things when I try to grab them.Does this count as a visual impairment? I usually just call it \"messed up eyesight\", but people tend to only take that as me needing glasses and then things are fixed, so I don't feel like it's a good enough description. \n",

      "Am I being sensitive? I feel like all I do is rant about everything that keeps going wrong at school, there are teachers who deal with special Ed needs but I feel like I want the visually impaired perspective to tell me if I should be offended.Okay this is what happened, its going to need a bit of context so pls hang in there- I was in my class and and I get called on and I tell my teacher that “I don’t know, I didn’t hear the question“, this response made her kinda mad because she responded in a tone with “that isn’t an acceptable answer“ and said something along the lines of if I ever wasn’t following I needed to raise my hand and ask for help, right now this seems like a very reasonable response from the teacher but there are a few things to take into account, to answer the question we had to read the textbook and talk to our peers, whilst we were meant to be talking to our peers I was trying to open up my online enlarged textbook, it takes a few moments to download every time and on top of that I was trying to read the relevant page, whilst doing this I’m trying to ask my friend sitting next to me what the question was because I didn’t hear her ask since I was still trying to get the textbook up while she said the question- so basically overall I didn’t get to answer the question and mostly because I take a lot longer to read than everyone else and I didn’t get the chance to explain that because of the teachers attitude. One thing that really made me mad was that after she said that it was unacceptable she said something about how I should raise my hand if I’m ever lost, I feel like she was basically alluding to the idea that I might struggle to keep up because of my sight impairment- which if that was her genuine concern she shouldn’t have yelled that in front of the class because there was no need to single me out like that in front of everyone.   She knows that it takes me longer to read and stuff so I don’t know why she didn’t just ask someone else after I said that I didn’t know. It’s a part of my EHCP that I need extra time and she is well aware of this. It makes me mad because whatever I miss in lesson due to sometimes needing more time outside of lesson, I always finish later in my own time- she knows this and my grades reflect that I’m not a cause for concern in any way which just made her reaction even more frustrating to me. I just found out that I’m experiencing sight loss (further sight loss to my impaired vision) last week, I was planning on talking to all of my teachers and informing them about it, telling them that whatever work I miss in lesson I’ll make up for later- and then that happened.I don’t know why but that thing that happened in my class made me really upset I think I’m really emotional because of the news about the sight loss and that triggered me, I ended up tearing up a bit in lesson, going to the bathroom and I had a panic attack (which really sucked but thankfully it didn’t last very long and I was relatively fine for the rest of the day). The only people that saw me become upset was my friend sitting next to me and this other guy who sat on the other side of me, apparently that guy told the teacher while I was in the bathroom that she must have made me upset because my friend heard her say ‘I’ll talk to her after the lesson ends‘. I walked out pretty quickly after the bell rang, I thought she would find me later in the day to address it but didn’t.I feel like she messed up a bit but don’t know what to do because I guess in some aspects her response can be justified but at the same time it isn’t. Also I haven’t properly recovered from the stress it induced, which is going to effect my ability to work in that class for a while and has made me scared about talking to my teachers about sight loss, especially her and I have a lesson with her first period tomorrow.What should I do? \n",

I used to go to an eye hospital from birth but got discharged at  age 10.

I guess I already have a low self esteem and I live in a backwoods redneck area where people can be pretty harsh and forthcoming. Does anyone have any advice adjusting to H/A's mid life? How did you get yourself to wear them? Were the changes pretty signifigant? \n",

      "Am I being too sensitive? I feel like all I do is rant about everything that keeps going wrong at school, there are teachers who deal with special Ed needs but I feel like I want the visually impaired perspective to tell me if I should be offended.Okay this is what happened, its going to need a bit of context so pls hang in there-I was in my class and and I get called on and I tell my teacher that “I don’t know, I didn’t hear the question“, this response made her kinda mad because she responded in a tone with “that isn’t an acceptable answer“ and said something along the lines of if I ever wasn’t following I needed to raise my hand and ask for help, right now this seems like a very reasonable response from the teacher but there are a few things to take into account, to answer the question we had to read the textbook and talk to our peers, whilst we were meant to be talking to our peers I was trying to open up my online enlarged textbook, it takes a few moments to download every time and on top of that I was trying to read the relevant page, whilst doing this I’m trying to ask my friend sitting next to me what the question was because I didn’t hear her ask since I was still trying to get the textbook up while she said the question- so basically overall I didn’t get to answer the question and mostly because I take a lot longer to read than everyone else and I didn’t get the chance to explain that because of the teachers attitude. One thing that really made me mad was that after she said that it was unacceptable she said something about how I should raise my hand if I’m ever lost, I feel like she was basically alluding to the idea that I might struggle to keep up because of my sight impairment- which if that was her genuine concern she shouldn’t have yelled that in front of the class because there was no need to single me out like that in front of everyone.She knows that it takes me longer to read and stuff so I don’t know why she didn’t just ask someone else after I said that I didn’t know. It’s a part of my EHCP that I need extra time and she is well aware of this. It makes me mad because whatever I miss in lesson due to sometimes needing more time outside of lesson, I always finish later in my own time- she knows this and my grades reflect that I’m not a cause for concern in any way which just made her reaction even more frustrating to me. I just found out that I’m experiencing sight loss (further sight loss to my impaired vision) last week, I was planning on talking to all of my teachers and informing them about it, telling them that whatever work I miss in lesson I’ll make up for later- and then that happened.I don’t know why but that thing that happened in my class made me really upset I think I’m really emotional because of the news about the sight loss and that triggered me, I ended up tearing up a bit in lesson, going to the bathroom and I had a panic attack (which really sucked but thankfully it didn’t last very long and I was relatively fine for the rest of the day). The only people that saw me become upset was my friend sitting next to me and this other guy who sat on the other side of me, apparently that guy told the teacher while I was in the bathroom that she must have made me upset because my friend heard her say ‘I’ll talk to her after the lesson ends‘. I walked out pretty quickly after the bell rang, I thought she would find me later in the day to address it but didn’t.I feel like she messed up a bit but don’t know what to do because I guess in some aspects her response can be justified but at the same time it isn’t. Also I haven’t properly recovered from the stress it induced, which is going to effect my ability to work in that class for a while and has made me scared about talking to my teachers about sight loss, especially her and I have a lesson with her first period tomorrow.What should I do?edit: title should say “am I being too sensitive?” \n",

About ten days ago, a nasty infection came from nowhere and spread to my mastoid, destroying everything in its path. I underwent a mastoidectomy, in which my surgeon removed my stapes and incus as well due to infection. I am completely deaf in my right ear. Because of the infection, my cochlea will begin to ossify in about a month, so surgeries need to be scheduled for relatively soon. The surgeon seemed to be pushing for a cochlear implant, but I've read some conflicting reports of \"quality of life\" with a CI in someone with SSD. I just wanted to know if there were any resources you all knew of where I could compare the CROS, BAHA, and implant. I have many audiology appointments coming up to discuss the options with them, but I like to look ahead and get a general grasp of what I'm looking at. Thank you!  \n",

      "How can I better see the titles of movies/series on Netflix? Hello, I've got a question for y'all. I like to watch stuff on Netflix but one big problem I've been having for years is that I can't really see the titles of movies or series. I've got a tiny bit of eyesight left but really just a tiny bit (and only on one eye). When I want to read the title of a movie/series, I need to zoom in like crazy. The fancy fonts and weird color combos (e.g. dark blue title on a grey background) already make it extremely difficult but on top of that, Netflix has this stupid thing where all the thumbnails begin to play a trailer when your mouse cursor touches them. I get that Netflix wants to have \"cool\" thumbnails... I suppose sighted people find this really exciting. Obviously, I'd rather just have a dry list of written titles. But I'm especially frustrated by the fact that Netflix can't at least write the title of a movie/series underneath the thumbnail in a little box where nothing moves and it's just black font on white background (or vice versa).Anyway, how do you guys deal with this? Any advice? \n",

      "How do you handle people grabbing you without asking? Hi,So I have been having an ongoing problem for the past 7 months since I started using a white cane.  I am a frequent traveler on public transit which includes both bus and above ground light rail.  I also travel in some not so great parts of town on my normal routes.  This has made itself once since I started.  I was followed home by a random guy on the bus and had a hard time getting him to leave me alone and I sort of panicked when he got physical.  Police reports were filed but he was never caught, this isn't uncommon in my neighborhood so I've just been rolling with it.What that did though was make me extremely paranoid about people in public, especially on public transit.The reason why I'm posting now is because since using the cane people have been grabbing me, without asking, I presume to try to be helpful.  Most recently was yesterday where I didn't have enough functional eyesight (I'm partially blind with some restricted albeit usable central vision) to properly see where I was going exactly but I was managing well and I was confident with my cane skills.  I heard one of the doors open on the train and I started moving towards it and out of nowhere a man grabbed my cane arm and dragged me to another door.  (I'll add that I like to be in the front of the train at a specific door so I know exactly where I am when I get to my destination station platform.)  I was irritated that he had messed up my orientation, but more than that when he actually grabbed me I became very anxious.  I sort of thought back to a few months ago and I almost shoved him off me, I think my brain was going too fast to think to do that.  I don't like people touching me in public, and I especially don't like it if they don't even bother to ask.  I don't mind receiving help, but I want to agree to the help and have the right to refuse it if I don't want it.Is this just a thing that happens where I am located?  This happens a lot to me when I'm crossing roads and navigating public transit and I always get really freaked out when it happens but I've never said anything about it to the people doing it.  If it does happen to you does it bother you as much as it seems to bother me?  I'm trying to figure out if I'm just insane and/ or hyper-paranoid or if my frustrations/ anxiety about this is something that other people deal with. I appreciate it. \n",

Once I get the sound processor, I'll presumably have the opposite problem, with that ear being way better than my other. What was your experience in getting used to this imbalance?Also curious as to how long the pain lasted. This one probably is somewhat \"YMMV\" and surgeon dependent.

At least until I've had my aids in for a while, and it starts all over again.) Combined with other annoyances such as general discomfort and listening fatigue, years later I'm still at a point where I'm pulling them out and going without whenever possible.I've been wondering lately if a different earmold style might help some of these issues. I've been meaning to get new ones made anyway, and have been wondering if skeleton earmolds might reduce the sweating/discomfort issue. Obviously the very best person to assess what's going to work well for me is a professional, but my audiologist doesn't wear hearing aids himself, so he's not exactly working from a personal perspective.  I'd prefer to have some opinions from actual users.So with all that said:* What style of earmold do you use, or have you used in the past? Pros and cons?* What's your severity of loss? (I've heard conflicting information on how well skeleton earmolds will work with higher degrees of loss.)* Annnnnd: I'm twenty-eight years old and working for a non-profit doing energy crisis intervention services. Am I past the age of being able to reasonably get away with funky colors? ;] \n",

      "blind services for school ideas? My daughter is almost 13 and just had the evaluation for services at school due to vision loss (but not legally blind at this point). She does qualify and the following are going to be emplemented: text to speech and read and write software with a laptop to help with her thought/organizational skills. I am recommending decluttering of extraneous information for charts, graphs, maps etc. and typing software that she can access at any time. We will also be contacted by the local blind childrens specialists. They have brought up learning braille but she feels like its just going to be added work, and with her struggling to read worry if it will be too hard on her. But was wondering if there are any other accommodations i should request. She is in resource classes due to intellectual disability and still has a very hard time with reading. (6th grade but reads at beginning of 2nd grade level) but now some days she cant read at all, which is what brought this on. Medical: she has a brain tumor in mid vermis (suspected to be low grade glioma) but also has IIH (some drs think kts not iih and is in fact from the brain tumor but wont be proven unless removed) she has increased cranial pressure, papilledema, a swollen ventricles in her brain that has worsened at every mri. She has drussen deposits but no flecks. Also has decreased peripheral vision, and left eye vision can not be corrected with glasses.  (She has a retina appt set up to rule out stargardts as i have it and it runs in the family) she has started diamoxx and are hopeful it will stop her vision from worsening.

      "Strange Bluetooth Issue I am trying to use a pair of second generation Airpods with NVDA.  I immediately noticed two problem.  The first was that the volume kept fluctuating and the speech kept cutting off.  I found an add-on to prevent that from occurring, and it works well.  The second problem is that whenever I try to record something, the speed of the speech increases so drastically that I can't comprehend what's being said, the voice changes, and the volume of NVDA increases.  I am then forced to set the speed to 0 to bring it to some kind of normal level, though the voice is still strange.  The only way to make things return to normal is to stop the recording, then to return to my usual speaking rate.  This also happens when I try to change sounds settings in Windows.

I would sign back to the and they would give me a blank look. A deer in the headlights look if you will. Turns out they were scammers trying to make people feel sorry for them by saying they were deaf. The first one was an Antonio Banderas look-alike who called himself Pedro. When I realized he was a fake, I signed to him that he doesn't know ASL because he's a fake. He needed to leave, now. The next person that came up was a black woman who called herself Caneesha. I busted her as a fake as well, but she kept picking all the flowers out of my mother's flowerpots and giving them to me as a gift or she kept going through my truck and pulling out wire clothes hangers. I kept telling her to leave but she wouldn't. Finally I just go inside my parents house and lock the door behind me leaving her outside. I get on my parents computer and look up dead scammers and I'm on this weird discussion forum / email thing and turns out Dr. P (one of my professors from Uni) is in on this. She has nothing to do with deaf culture and teaches strictly British Literature. She's just a mixed bag when it comes to her feelings and habits. While this dream is strange, it's strange because I recently lost the remainder of my hearing.

      "Advice on feeling embarrassed Hi all, Just looking for advice or reassuring words because I'm feeling a bit embarrassed right now, when I know I shouldn't be. For a bit of context, I was born with sensorineural hearing loss (profound in left, mild-moderate in right) and I've never used hearing aids as I cannot have them (they wouldn't be helpful with my deafness). About four months ago, I suddenly became profoundly deaf. I'm still waiting for my ENT to figure out how or why this happened. So I've been relying on lip-reading and dictation apps these past few months.Last week, I was offered a fantastic volunteering opportunity in an industry I really want to work in! It's a small regional sub-group as part of a countrywide one. (If this makes sense?) Anyways to the point. We had our first committee meeting tonight, where the Chair would have us do introductions, go through the agenda and goals for the upcoming months/year. This is where the issue is. I was very anxious and worried about the meeting to begin with as it took place over Zoom. I've been privileged enough to not have to make many accommodations with my deafness, now I don't know what to ask for or how to make these meetings work. I asked for captions and the Chair happily did this, plus they wrote up a long transcript of the meeting for me to read through beforehand! I am grateful for this! However, the captions didn't work in the meeting. We tried and tried to get them on, it would say 'Captions Enabled,' but nothing would come up live or in the transcript. I had already missed about 20 minutes of the meeting because the host didn't see my message and they were halfway through the introductions (I think). They kept ending the call and restarting and doing all sorts to get them on. Everybody (about 12+ members) were waiting for the meeting to continue, but couldn't as I couldn't understand what was going on and I can't hear at all.I felt SO embarrassed and awkward as they knew it was to do with me. I ended up telling them to continue on with the meeting and I had to just sit there and read through my email transcript. I was bored and felt left out. I completely missed the introductions of my peers and the questions they asked. I ended up using the dictate action on Microsoft Word just to get some sort of transcript, but even that wasn't entirely accurate.All in all, I feel so anxious about the next meeting and I'm wondering whether to stay within the role as we'll have future Zoom calls. I know it's not their fault, it's technical difficulties. But I'm now thinking about my future job-hunting where zoom calls/telephone calls are the 'norm.' I'm already struggling with my deafness as it is, because my family think I'm going to 'magically' regain the hearing I did have and I know it's not going to happen. I am confident in my Deaf Identity but there are times where I feel so low about it, because I don't have the support.If you read this far, thank you I appreciate it. \n",

They formed their hypothesis after they noticed 31 people who died suddenly during sleep had hearing loss in their right ear. They did experiments in mice from 2011-2013.

      "Negative Experiences with Ignorant/Cruel Audiologists? During my sophomore year of college, I had a very negative encounter with an audiologist who spent the whole appointment telling me how damaged I was, and that I was basically unrealistic to expect myself to do well in the world. She then proceeded to send me pamphlets in the mail for a year, which referred to deafness as a \"horrible disease.\"Since then, I've noticed more than a few d/Deaf and HOH people mentioning offhand that audiologists are generally fairly audist. I even just happened to be there when a HOH friend of mine came home crying from her own negative experience, in which the audiologist had taken note of her university sweatshirt and literally scoffed at her major, encouraging her to leave her dream field because of her deafness.I've heard about this often enough to know it's not just a fluke, but I'm interested in finding out just how bad of a problem this is.

      "Do signs that have braille on them help the blind? Walking around schools, towns, and college campuses has lead me to encounter a large number of signs that have braille on them.  Usually these signs are location markers that tell you what building you are standing outside of, whether it is the men's or women's bathroom, or what room you are standing outside of.  When I was younger, I used to think that these were signs were a great thing.  This way, anyone who is blind would be able to read the sign and know where they are at just like a sighted person can!  Only, I noticed a problem as I got older.  How does a blind person know where the sign is at so they can read them?  I guess this question is more or less asking if any of you guys manage to get around throughout the day.  I mean no offense and am genuinely curious.  The lack of sight seems to make it incredibly difficult to get around.  It wouldn't be so bad in an area that you know and are familiar with, but what about in new locations?Referring back to the signs, I understand that braille should be on these signs because that way they will act as markers so people will know where they are at.  But the question became harder and harder for me to answer as I went along.  At first I figured that a blind person would feel along the wall for these signs, but how would you know there was even a sign there?  I can kind of piece together how a blind person would be able to understand the layout of a room by moving around it with their cane.  But how do you manage to find specific locations when the area, building, or whatever is completely foreign to you?  I hope I didn't come across as offensive in my curiosity, and I do look forward to your answers :) \n",

She actually asked me for help getting to her classes which is something she would never normally do. She was shaking and crying alone in the library when I saw her after that happened.The worst part is no one would say who did it and because there's no cameras in the locker room, nobody even got in trouble and she didn't get her stuff back. \n",

      "Newly HOH and feeling lost I recently lost almost all the hearing in my left ear. I do alright in quiet environments but as a SAHM to two small children, it's almost never quiet and almost all my socializing is at their activities, playdates, or at church events. Now my ear is always ringing, I have constant headaches, and I can barely hear what people are saying to me. Financially, we're right in the spot where we don't qualify for aid but can't afford HAs or ASL classes. I've been trying to learn ASL on my own in the little free time I have but no one I know speaks it. I'm really hesitant to seek out the local Deaf community (I'm in the DC suburbs) because I have pretty bad social anxiety and reading about how some people have been treated has scared me off.   I have no idea where to go from here. \n",

      "Sabrina Blount, a deaf black woman, was brutally raped and assaulted - she needs your help. More details inside. Hey, guys. This is a long, horrid story, so I'll post all these links with the details. In short, Sabrina was raped, beaten, and then run over twice by a car - by two assailants who also happened to be deaf as well. She has a long road to recovery, and her mother lost her job and house as a result of having to care for Sabrina and her 18-month old son.The irony is that a well-off deaf white couple in a wealthy suburban home had their belongings lost everything in the first floor level of their house in a flood recently; and [their GoFundMe page raised $32,000 in just a matter of three days]( while Ms. Blount's page only raised $5,000 in 27 days. Now the 31-day deadline is nearing, and this is now spreading like wildfire and people are finally waking up in the community and donating in breakneck speed. The white couple also put their word in for everyone to help pitch in to help this young lady.... a few hours too late - because the controversy and heat is building up on them. They knew of this for quite a bit of time, yet remained silent until very recently.  Please help her out, even if it's only a dollar that you can afford. All human lives matter, regardless of race, class, and background. We really need to stamp out racism in our community - it exists and is holding us all back. Thank you! **LINKS:**News Article of the horrible incident [HERE]( Facebook page [HERE]( GoFundMe page for donations to help Sabrina Blount [HERE]( \n",

But i feels like a very unfortunate person is now victim of opened boxes that brought from UPS. How surprisingly other carriers doesn't damaged my box when i used to ordered since. That's a UPS carrier which i blamed them, i see same driver at everytime when i delivered has torn my box, honestly i have no proof that if he opened or from the UPS factory. However he knew that i am deaf without communicate needed, just sign on their own device at the door and leave simply without a greeting comment. Also i tried went to the factory where the shipment holds. Again my box has opened also, it has torn of a tape on the box. I wondered if employees are learned of my name and address that can damaged when i order every time after aware of a deaf customer. Over 15 times that opened my boxes, now i would not able to order again since in a few months when i stopped. The address that i lived here for 20 years and has not moved. Also the box belonged to my grandmother used with same address has opened, that's a one time. There is no way to change address if employees learned it already. Please help...

      "So glad I found this subreddit, tax question Hi everyone, I first just wanted to introduce myself.  I have had bad vision my whole life, but have seen a decrease in my vision of late.  No vision in one eye except light, and 20/500 in my other eye.  I have been looking for a forum for blind people, but most don't look very active until I found this one. Honestly, it has been such a hassle to get answers on my questions.  I work with my state's organization which has been a tremendous help, but I'm thinking discussing and hearing from folks who have gone through vision lose would be the best source. I'm sure I will have a lot of questions and thoughts as I lose my vision, but wanted to start with a basic one.  The past few years I've done my taxes on my own online through H&R Block.  This year I qualify as legally blind and have a letter from my doctor.  I recall reading in the past that the first time you file as legally blind, you have to do it in person instead of online.  I can't seem to find that anymore though.  I went into a H&R Block store and they were no help, and were quite rude about the whole thing.  I'm curious if anyone has experience in this.  I'd hate to do anything wrong.Thanks and looking forward to interacting with you all!   \n",

      "How to explain deafness to hearing people? I'm losing my hearing and it feels like no one around me understands. I can't get anyone to meet me halfway. I've asked my coworkers two things: face me when you speak and make sure you have my attention first. They can't even manage that. I swear, if I hear from one of them \"Why don't you just get a cochlear?\" or \"Oh, well you can talk to me now, so it must not be THAT bad.\" one more time, I'm tempted to punch someone in the face. Especially since I've been working there for three years. You think they'd understand by now. It's not just coworkers, either. It's anyone in public who thinks I'm rude for ignoring them, my family who has the same idea of \"if you can talk to me right now, you're fine,\" etc. So, my question for the deafies: How do you explain your deafness to hearing people? How do you make them understand well enough that everything is not on you? Because I'm really tired of working twice as hard to follow along and everyone just telling me I'm stupid. \n",

      "Dealing with work interactions while half blind Hey everyone! I’ve got a question for half blind folks in the workforce. I have macular scarring in one eye, which means I have no peripheral vision (or vision in general lol)on one side. However, you can’t tell I’m visually impaired just by looking at me, and I don’t use any aids. Whenever people walk to talk to me on my blind side, I generally don’t try and look at them since twisting my body far enough to see them is physically uncomfortable. This is fine for friends and family familiar with my lack of vision, but I’ve had a few coworkers get visibly annoyed by it. How do I deal with these situations? I am generally open about my blindness, but it’s annoying/makes me slightly uncomfortable to have to explain the issue every single time. Do I need to get over it, or is there a good way to fake looking at people without actually knowing exactly where they are?Thanks in advance! \n",

      "Girlfriend likely going completely blind; unsure what to expect I've been dating this girl for nearly a year and when we started dating she had already told me about problems with her vision. She could still do pretty much everything she needed to be independent, but for a while her vision has been getting gradually worse to the point that she can no longer drive as of about a week ago.Doctors don't have a diagnosis for her. Whatever is causing her vision loss, it likely won't recover because of damage to the optic nerve. Doctors have put her condition under the umbrella of optic neuritis. Could be MS so she has MRIs every 6 weeks. So far it looks like an auto immune disease that has only affected the optic nerve.I love her and would build a life with her but the future is looking kind of scary. I work a lot but don't make a lot of money. We have been planning on moving in together but now that might be put on hold. She lives with her parents and is trying to finish school but her field was something absolutely requiring the use of your eyes. This means she'll have to start over and she has no idea what else might interest her career wise.Looking at the worst case scenario of total and permanent vision loss, and assuming we try and make a life together, what lies ahead? As much foresight as I try to exercise in order to be prepared to provide all the help she'll need, I'm sure there will be so much more that I can't anticipate. Lay it out for me, how can I come to a sustainable arrangement assuming she goes completely blind? \n",

I started to believe I was after listening to music full volume everyday to and from school with my air pods. I’ve stopped after I realized what I was doing and have recently been having sensitive ears, ear pain, and it feeling quieter after having the volume a little loud for a while.What leaves me second guessing is how my friend’s air pods are much louder than mine and I’ve had mine for a few years. I tested both mine and his and my 80dB sounds more like his 60dB. I also am not 100% sure because when my parents yell for me from the living room (im usually using headphones at moderate volume with my door shut) I am able to hear them.I have visited the doctor once for ear pain and suspicion of hearing loss but they didn’t check me for hearing loss and instead gave me something to inhale for (what they said was) fluid in my ears.I don’t know what to do and if there is some kind of at home test I can do just to make sure. \n",

Anyway, long story short I've been Deaf my whole life but I've had some hearing, I signed as a child but it wasn't sign language, just to communicate with my parents who have no exposure to Deafness. I grew able to function as a hearing person but it becomes increasingly more difficult as when I was born I had about 30% normal hearing and am now almost completely deaf. I recently learned about Deaf as a culture and slowly became comfortable calling myself Deaf. one of my friends told me I couldn't call myself deaf because I can still hear, don't sign (currently learning ASL) and have never even heard of the culture until very recently. what little hearing I do have is very painful as it is just constant unintelligible and very annoying noise unless I work very hard to listen to one person while reading lips and making them speak loudly and clearly.

      "Deaf and maybe ADHD? I’m profoundly deaf in both ears since I was 3 and I’m implanted with cochlear implants ever since. For the past years I’ve been struggling with a potential diagnosis such as ADHD but I’m not entirely sure since a lot of the symptoms are very similar and have a tendency to be misdiagnosed as autism, add/adhd, and hearing loss but if that’s the case, then what differs from a “normal” deaf versus ADHD deaf. I struggle with similar experiences like APD and I can get super fatigued from listening and concentrating and usually avoid situations that involve needing me to think ahead and plan on surprises such as “What do i say if i can’t understand under a normal conversation pretense if i can’t understand or how much time before I can process anything?” before having to sit in a social environment and focus on the background noise which makes it worse. I want to seek a diagnosis but I can’t seem to find any resources about deaf and adhd, only that they can bleed into each other and that one would be more likely to be diagnosed as such. Keep in mind that I’m the only deaf person in the family and was the only one of two deaf in my middle and high school. I’ve also taken a lot of self screening tests and it’s more likely to be the case. I’m just confused about it all because I’m trying to determine my own accommodations since being a “successful case” for cochlear implants makes me seem like a hearing person to everyone so I can’t always explain my case every single time. :( \n",

I’ve tried to say to the CEO so many times how having live transcriptions on video messages is really helpful for people with hearing loss and that’s something we could show in a video campaign, and how important this would be to include the deaf community. Every time I bring this up he says he doesn’t want to include (in his words) “hearing impaired” people and doesn’t want it to be seen as an accessibility app. I’ve argued back every time that it won’t do that (not that there is anything wrong with that), it shows how inclusive the app can be for everyone because “everyone” should include deaf/hoh people. It would be a few seconds in a video of friends using the app to chat to each other as I want to show people in different scenarios using the app, but a few seconds of seeing a deaf/hoh person using the app is somehow ruining its impression on people. Then he said how he wants this app to be used on a broad scale, which confused me as I thought that’s exactly what showing deaf/hoh people using the app would do by showing how inclusive it can be. I generally don’t know what he means by that, how are deaf/hoh not included in the broad scale?I’ve had other issues when wanting to make content more inclusive for deaf/hoh people. I said that captions should be on all of our video content, he always says how captions can stop the content from “looking so good”.

      "Question: Tired of being Hung-Up on. Please help. I'm fed-up with being hung-up on all the time. I am trying to figure out a method I can use to decrease the odds that people hang up on my calls, and I'd love to get input from anyone out there who has an idea.The problem, of course, is that businesses / agencies / etc seem to just **LOVE** *(sarcasm)* to hang up on Relay calls. They seem to typically do this for one of three reasons:1. They get '**spooked**' by the Relay Operator, and their brains 'shut off', so they don't listen to the explanation at all, and just hang up.2. They get '**frustrated**' by the call being different than all their other calls, so they get moody, act rudely, and try to rush the call (sometimes by outright hanging up).3. **They know exactly** what a Relay Call is, but they literally **just refuse** to speak through the interpreter, and say crap like: \"Our policy is we don't answer Relay Calls for \\[XYZ reason\\],\" then hang up.   1. *(I realize I could 'report' their business for discrimination, however sometimes I just want to make a quick call, and not have to spend 4 hours reporting someone.)*&#x200B;This has been happening to me **a lot** lately, and it's become extremely frustrating. I will share some of my ideas below, but I've yet to find one that I actually like.&#x200B;**The workarounds I'm currently aware of are as follows:**1. Ask the Relay Operator to **NOT disclose** that they are a Relay Operator.   1. *(This can fail because, eventually, the other person feels like something is 'weird' about the call, and may end up hanging up.)*2. Ask the Relay Operator to **use a custom script** instead of their usual Relay Explanation.   1. *(For example, asking them to say something like: \"This is a relay service interpreting for a deaf person. Please speak as you would to any other person. there may be delays during interpretation.\")*3. Asking the Relay Operator to immediately **ask for a manager.**   1. *(The problem here is that managers aren't always better, and also hang up on Relay Calls.)*&#x200B;**These are some workarounds I'm toying with the idea of:**1. Asking the Relay Operator to **simply say:** \"The person who is calling is deaf, and would like you or a manager to **give them a call back** when you are able to speak with them through an interpreter?\"   1. *(The problem here is \\[A\\] it's annoying, \\[B\\] you may never get a callback, and you might've waited on hold for an hour, and \\[C\\] when they call the number, another Relay Operator will answer and they may get \"scared off\", so they could still hang up.)*2. Asking the Relay Operator to say: \"You are about to speak with a deaf person. **It is illegal to hang up** on them. May I please get your first name so they can call you back if the call is disconnected?\"   1. *(The problem here is \\[A\\] it's aggressive, \\[B\\] it may backfire and make them hang up even faster than usual, \\[C\\] I don't think it's 'technically' illegal to hang up - it's just illegal to discriminate, which is impossible to prove because they would just say the call \"Got disconnected,\" or \"Was an accident.\"*&#x200B;I'm out of ideas. I'd love for anyone to share their thoughts or maybe solutions they use that have been successful. I honestly don't care how 'weird' the solution is, nor do I mind too much if it sounds a little aggressive (so long as it gets the job done). Basically: I want a method that check-mates the other person into having to take my call without hanging up on me.&#x200B;Thank you, everyone, in advance! \n",

      "Can audiograms be wrong? I had my first audiogram in March after some challenges hearing people wearing masks. I was surprised to be diagnosed with reverse slope hearing loss with a range between 60db at .5kHz and 30db at 8kHz. So basically low frequency hearing loss. All of my tested points are below the 'speech banana' but I can follow and join in with conversations without too much trouble. At the time I also had fairly severe pulsatile tinnitus, which was investigated and I believe might have been stress related. Now it's November, and I've just got my hearing aids. My audiologist says my hearing loss is considerable and it seems yes some days I miss things, need things repeated etc. But with my hearing aids it feels like WAY too much noise. I'm concerned that there might have been a mistake in the audiogram and I'm actually not dealing with such bad hearing loss or not as much as it first appeared. I changed jobs and my tinnitus isn't as bad now, so I'm wondering if it could be that? Maybe I am just in denial, but I find it impossible to believe that people with normal hearing operate with the amount of sound that I'm getting from my hearing aids. It is like being bombarded with noise. I feel relief with I take the aids off and without them I can hear my family, but just not if they are out of the room unless they're yelling. Is this a common feeling? Or should I request another audiogram? \n",

BUT YOU CAN TALK / CAN U HEAR ME WHAT I M SAYING....\" and all bullshit questions etc..., so whateverso its been a gradual, slow decline, the things is, it takes a lot of energy and effort on my part to understand people and hear etc...hearings aids make my ears ache, i have to focus on a person s face to lipread entirely, use context clues to understand, etc... i have been losing my hearing steadily over the years and rely on lipreading and hearings aids etc...but they don t help all that much at all and i have ever gone without health assurance, my biggest fear is that i won t even able to hear sounds of nature and all...and i won t have a chance to have a good opportunity and i m starting to learn ASL with my gf ldr and i want to ask for your help in finding organizations abroad and living there to facilitate my life to benefit from cochlear implant or any other aid to facilitate my communication with the social and professional environment, and despite my academic qualification i got my diploma degree in automotive diagnostic engineering and industrial maintenance but i haven t finished my studies yet because my field in master doesn t exist in my country and i tried to contact the universities and i didn t receive any and i don t have the means to finance my studies its been 3 years i haven t studied and no job and i just did several internship in leading automotive companies such as Toyota, Honda, Renault and others, i have been rejected several times for job offers without even getting an interview and the disability association in my country, i really don t know what is going on, i think all that because of my hearings disability may be the reason for these rejections and all, especially since i can t afford to have a cochlear implant surgery \"in my country is too hell expensive to get two, one cost 28000dollar BUT SERIOUSLY\"and i m asking for your support to overcome this obstacle and i have worked hard and surviving to achieve my academic and professional and goals and its discouraging me a lot that getting me lost of hope to be repeatedly denied opportunities and rough life...and they r going to deny me since they deny people with disability and i don t have a lot of doctors records to back up a lot of stuff and though my doctor have told me that i better to go Belgium or France and i m trying to find organizations and i don t know how to contact them and i m going need more and more care, though nobody has told me HOW THE FUCK TO DO THAT...so i m sitting here and debating.... i m trying to figure this out and still had no luck, well i need someone to help me walk me through this bullshit and my parents doesn t want to understand anyway, i wanted your opinions and ur help and whatever advice you have throw my way, thank you for understanding... \n",

      "Frustrated with everyday Hearing people. This is my first time posting on here. I seriously need to vent.I am a Deaf male who has grown increasingly annoyed more than usual at the monotonous, stereotypically repetitive interactions with Hearing people.\\-Viewing me like I'm mentally inferior when in reality an IQ test I took qualifies me for Mensa membership - thus eclipsing me above most Hearings.\\-Mistaking me as someone who's easily taken advantage of when in reality I will raise hell.\\-My grandmother being shocked at the fact that I can drive. Most olds I interact with are surprised when they discover I can handle everyday tasks on my own, even hooking up my own modem and router to the outside coax cables. Something they always thought you needed a \"technician\" for.\\-When using relay interpreters, the same old \"is this the translator/interpreter speaking or (name)?\" NO, YOU ARE SPEAKING TO ME. HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT?\\-The all-too familiar passive-aggressive look on customer service representative's faces when I point out their error. As if I'm too below them to be able to correct them.\\-Constantly getting called \"buddy.\" What, do you think I have Downs syndrome?\\-Constantly getting rejected by hearing females out of fear that I will pass on my \"inferior\" genetics when in fact, I am the first deaf person in my family as far back as we could track. And no, there was no alcohol/drug abuse - I come from a long line of very healthy individuals. And I'm attractive, to boot.\\-And then there's the feeling like I never could relate to the Deaf community because they're so left-leaning, and most of their interest don't align with mine at all. Plus, I'm not even right-wing - not interested in politics. Plus, the drama that is so typical in Deaf circles and self-loathing just turns me off.There is a lot more to go into, but these are just a few of my biggest annoyances that I have to deal with on a daily basis.Rant over. \n",

      "How to deal with the friction of being blind Practically everything is harder when one's blind. Even if one has a normal amount of motivation to get something done, the succession of little obstacles can be very hard to overcome.Today for example I wanted to do a particular course. I installed the basic software for it, which works fine, but unfortunately the course expects you to use some other software on top, which is not really accessible. So in principle it might be possible to do, but I need to read another previous tutorial on how to manage the software.Now and then I want to learn some particular maths topic. The vast majority of the information is on inaccessible PDFs, or presented as images on the web. Sometimes one can get latex sources for things, and it becomes possible, though not pleasant, to get the information, but it makes it much harder than it should be.With music, similar problems: really hard to get a manual on, say, counterpoint, that I can actually read.So how do you deal with the fact that tasks that are trivial for other people become a constant struggle? Nothing is ever easy, and it gets incredibly tiring. Not because everything should be easy: obviously everyone finds obstacles in life. But the smallest things become difficult.Any suggestions appreciated. I've lived with blindness for 32 years but I'm running out of the determination necessary to constantly swim against the current.Sorry for the rant and feel free to remove this post if it's not appropriate. \n",

      "Is there anything I can do for hearing loss at this point? So, I don't know where to begin.  Long of the short, I was studying for a final and to drown out noisy neighbors, I played my headset very loud and wore earplugs.  I thought I was protecting my hearing with 32dbs ear plugs but I guess not.Anyhow I went to a doctor 2 weeks after complaining of ringing and issues and they said nothing they can really do besides go to ENT and have hearing test done to see how bad it is.  Basically, just deal with it.Well, its now a month later and I can tell the different in wearing headset.  I have to offset my headset one or two notches in the \"bad\" ear louder to balance out my hearing.I did have a hearing test done and have to have 40db to hear 8khz, 30 to hear 6khz (I think), and rest were 20dbs or lower.  The other ear is fine.So, is there any solution or studies out there that can help me?  Any experimental drugs that may be able to restore my hearing?

      "Binaural hearing aids? I am about 95% deaf in one ear and have lost a lot of high frequency detection in the other.  The 95% deafness was detected at age 5 when my hearing was checked going into Kindergarten.  The diagnosis is, and always has been \"nerve deafness\", which is apparently is the standard diagnosis when they just don't know what the problem might be.  I have gotten by with coping strategies my entire life (I am 55), by strategically positioning myself in conversations and by lipreading.  Unfortunately, the hearing in my \"good\" ear is now getting worse.  I do not have much \"hearing\" in my deaf ear, but I do detect vibrations.  For example, if I wear headphones, I definitely \"feel\" a difference if I remove the speaker from the bad ear, but if I try to listen only with the bad ear, I just hear muffled sounds and low bass unless I turn the sound up REALLY LOUD, at which point I might be able to identify a song, for example.  I recently stumbled on this YouTube video:   watch and listen to that beginning at 4:50, with headphones, to understand where I am coming from.  The BBC is using binaural sound to augment virtual reality experiences.  Amazingly, I have found that if I listen to the demo at about 4:50 into that video, I can tell which directions the sounds are coming from.  My left ear is my bad ear, and the sounds on the left are not as loud as the ones on my right, obviously, but I *can* tell they are coming from the left.  One of my biggest issues at this point in my life is that I basically *cannot* tell which direction sounds come from.  If there were hearing aids using binaural technology, I believe I would at least have the advantage of knowing from which direction sounds were coming from, which would be huge.   I actually had this idea a few years ago, while investigating binaural beats to sleep.  A set of hearing aids which communicated with each other via bluetooth and which synthesized the proper delay of the sounds from right to left or left to right would give me the ability to detect the direction from which sounds come.  Again, this would be huge.  In many social situations, I look stupid because people will be saying my name, but I don't know from which direction the sounds come.  Also, transmitting sounds from the bad side to the good side via a transmitting hearing aid pair, with the proper delay, i am confident my brain would eventually adapt by recognizing the delay and allow me not only to hear better but detect direction.Are there any companies working on this technology? \n",

(i.e - social isolation, not feeling involved in social circles of friends so much, being bullied at school)Even growing up I felt as a deaf person my parents had to do a lot of talking for me, that I couldn't speak well myself with out other people asking what did I say.I wondered to ask if deaf/hoh people are more needy/clingy or if that's just me?I often feel afraid to speak out or express myself because it's tricky to do speaking wise. I don't hear lot so I often rely on someone else to work out what's being said. So when this break up occurred it brought back a lot of previous feelings of rejection. I wondered if it was connected partly to do with the upbringing of my deafness. or if I wasn't deaf maybe I'd be more attractive?I  don't think the answers lie in her and her liking me, the answer lies within me and recognising all pain and that I need to look after myself.Do other people have any other similar experiences of anything mentioned above?

      "[rant] blind is not offensive! So, this has come up in discussions I've been a part of recently, and the idea just makes me foamy and ranty and blarg! So forgive me for a moment.  The opinions expressed are my own, not the other mods, and I don't represent anyone but myself.  Disclaimer: contains terms some may find offensive, but is still entirely PG.  This is self-identified as a rant, and so is right on the edge of what can be reasonably allowed in postings.  Let's try not to cross that line in the comments, K? Thanks!  But I'd love to read a good counter-rant.Seriously though, who got the idea that the word blind was offensive, and who's bottomless hole of fake-PC inanity did they rip it out of?  Can we please, for once and all, stuff it back in there?  Let's have a quick look at the list of organizations helping those with sight issues: The Royal National Institute of the _BLIND_, The Canadian National Institute of the _BLIND_, the National Federation of the _BLIND_, The American Council of the _BLIND_, The American Printing House for the _BLIND_, The Canadian _BLIND_ alliance, The World _BLIND_ Union...are you noticing a pattern? Are you?  If you're one of the people trying to put across the idea that the word blind is offensive, then no, you're probably not.  This is obviously because you're so deeply disengaged from the community of _BLIND_ people, and reality in general, I'm surprised you can still communicate with the rest of us from whatever planet you're living on.  If you're interested in getting re-connected with reality, think about it this way.  Is The Canadian Foundation for Physically Disabled Persons called \"Cripples Canada\"?  No it isn't!  Because that group of people decided they didn't appreciate being called cripples, so they don't call themselves that.  Does an organization called \"Spastics USA\" exist?  No!  Because people with physical disabilities don't call themselves spastics.  And there is no organization called \"retards international\", either!  Same reason!  And yet, some people apparently think that we blind people are a group of helpless, hopeless, dis-empowered children.  If we were offended by the word blind, we would make the organizations that we all participate in change it.  But hey, look!  See all those organizations above?  None of them have been renamed!  Nobody is even attempting to rename them, as far as I know!  I wonder why? Can you guess? Can you?  That's right!  It's because we're not offended by the word blind!  So, when you say that the word blind is offensive, you're far more offensive than a hundred million uses of the word blind. Because what you're really saying is that I'm too helpless and stupid to get the organizations I belong to to change it myself, so you'd better stand up and do it for me.  Well, *SIT THE HELL BACK DOWN!*Do you disagree with me?  I'd love to hear about it in the comments.  Seriously, it'd be nice to hear what your reasons for thinking this are, so I can respond to them.  Because right now, I honestly don't understand what you're thought process must be, other than a need to protect a group of people you believe are too helpless to do it ourselves.  Hey, it's always possible, but extremely unlikely, that you'll be so convincing that I'll be moved to try and rename this community to /r/visuallyimpaired.  I wouldn't bet on it, though.In closing, I have no problem with political correctness.  I support and uphold the right of every community to call itself what it wishes, and I regularly change my speech patterns as I learn about the desires of different groups, as we all grow and change.  I also uphold the right of every person to call herself or himself whatever she or he wants.  If you call yourself visually impaired, good for you, and I'll stop calling you blind.  But how dare you tell me what I'm allowed to call myself, and how dare you refuse to call me blind. That's the label I've picked for myself, and that's the label many other communities also desire.  So use and accept it!   \n",

      "Cochlear implant therapy at age 20? :/ Worth it? I had the implant done in 1999 but hated using my CI as a kid. I would probably go back in time if I could and slap my five year old self silly and tell her/me to go to therapy and stop hiding the CI in goddamn sandboxes. Since it's still me, I don't think it'd count as abuse. ;P Now, joking aside, I do know there are some steep drawbacks to starting therapy at 20 versus the growing years. I can talk but... not well enough that even my parents will understand me 100% of the time, and I have profound bilateral hearing loss from Waardenburg's.

With my glasses my vision improves however if I'm being honest...not by much for my bad eye. My left eye is also blind however not as bad, I'm considering just covering up my right eye because of a few reasons relating to the blindness. Because of my terrible vision my eye is constantly way more squinted than my left(good) eye which I don't personally. On top of this, I used to not have glasses for years so my Eye doctor dumbed it down for me and said that my brain doesn't use my bad eye alot of the time. Would it be dumb to just simply give up on it and cover up? Be blunt and honest, yes it's my opinion however I wanna make sure I'm making the right one. \n",

      "D/HoH people- thoughts on my 🔇 tattoo? Hi! My background: I’m hoh with severe hearing loss in both ears. I use hearing aids and am learning ASL. I grew up in a hearing family and my hearing has slowly gotten worse over time (I was first diagnosed with hearing loss at age 12 and it was only moderate at that point) so I speak without a deaf accent and can lipread really well. So with lip reading and the help of my hearing aids I can communicate well without sign. I wasn’t comfortable wearing my hearing aids or identifying as deaf or HoH until I was about 17 when I started learning about the deaf community and more about ASL, and I am now pretty involved in the deaf community and semi-conversational in ASL (I understand most of what is said to me but my actual expressive skills are only okay and my grammar is shit lol)Anyways, I have the 🔇 symbol tattooed at behind my ear because accepting my hearing loss has been a very important thing in my life as I finally overcame years of my biggest insecurity and have grown to love it and the community that comes with it.However, I work with deaf people at a deaf school and I think the majority of them view me as a hearing person because I’m not fluent in asl, and I worry that they see my tattoo and think it’s insensitive or that I only have mild hearing loss and am appropriating their culture (despite the fact that I am in fact deaf). So I find myself trying to hide it now because I don’t want to offend people, but at the same time I know that I am deaf and that it is a meaningful tattoo to me.What are your thoughts on it? Would you be offended if you thought I was a hearing person with this tattoo or only had mild hearing loss and got it? \n",

Recently, I had to get rid of my car and am depending on others to get to/from work while I figure out what to do. My hearing loss has always impacted my balance, and it has made me less than confident riding a bicycle, but I am ready to get past this so I can gain some independence my 2 days that I am required to work in office (I am remote 3 days/week). My office is only max 1.5 miles from home. I am not opposed to walking, but it's all downhill through a part of town I wouldn't exactly feel safe walking through alone as a woman (29F) the times of day that I'd be walking. Also, the walk back uphill in July in the SE US sounds horrible. I'm contemplating an electric bike, electric trike, or moped. Do any of you have experience with these balance issues and been able to overcome them? Tips? Suggestions? A bike or scooter of some kind would also give me some less direct routes as options because I'd be moving faster than if I walked. I also worry about this since my deaf ear would be facing traffic. I really think it's been so long since I've ridden a bike that most of this is just fear of something I was bad at as a child, but I really don't want a car note right now. \n",

      "Deaf gain! I recently started a graduate program in medical illustration. I'm the first HoH/Deaf person that the program has had and I was pretty nervous coming in, especially for the Gross Anatomy course we take with the med students. Of course on the first day I told the professors about my hearing loss and what I need from them to do well (namely to look up so I can read their lips when they're identifying structures on the body)I then had to explain to my lab partners about deafness and how to interact with someone, which was fine (especially for the ones going on to med school, Lord knows doctors could use more exposure) - or at least I thought we were fine.A girl in my program (med illustration) who took some ASL classes in undergrad pulled me aside the other day to tell me that she overheard my lab mates' concerns that I'm falling behind and wanted to check in with me to see if it's true. I said no, that I'm doing just fine but that lab can be really confusing for me because 5 different people are trying to argue over what something is and I can't keep up so I stay quiet.Anyway! We had our first practice practicle today and I killed it. The professor even went so far as to comment on how I spelled everything correctly, which is important for the exam and something the other students were severely lacking. My secret? I fingerspell all the muscles and structures to myself as I'm studying, so even if I'm unsure about the spelling I can fingerspell it and see if it \"feels wrong\" to me.Now all my lab mates are referring to me for help during dissection, not only because I know my stuff, but because when I explain things I use classifiers to show spatial relationships of anatomy. Now people from other groups come up to me to ask me to explain things. . . And specifically ask me to use my hands.It's amazing how people can think that you're going to be the weak link for something like your ability to hear and then have the tables turned. :) Especially since I stopped aiming for med school in high school after being told that \"a deaf faggot can't become a doctor.\" TL;DR: deafness is actually a boon in learning anatomy. \n",

Now I'm visually impaired and on disability because of RP. I've been in a three year long fight with my employer's disability company who has been treating me like my claim has no merit. My insurance company forced me to get evaluated by the State blind services in a move to force me to take a job they knew I'd hate. They were trying to make me choose to leave voluntarily because that's just how nasty they are. The State doesn't work for the insurance company and had their own opinions. They correctly saw through the whole situation. They thought it would be a good idea if I went back to college to get another degree. My insurance company's response has been muted so far. I suspect the other shoe to fall any day. So that's the backstory. End result is I go back to college in January. I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around this. I can't read normal sized print so the textbook is going to be a challenge.

I haven't worn hearing aids, due to both the doctor I have seen since the beginning thought I would grow out of it.      Last August I got my third and final Tympanoplasty (a tougher version of a Myringoplasty) on my left ear that was supposed to fix my hearing. It has been one hell of a ride. What was supposed to fix my hearing has instead made it worse, but does not show up on a hearing test. In December I had was very rushed hearing test and the test showed an impossible increase of hearing in a 3 month time period . The whole time I was seeing the specialist he wouldn't talk to me he would talk to my dad. I am a 24 year old guy, I am the one  who is having, not my dad these problems talk to me. The doctor would just dismiss my pain and hearing problem saying nothing is wrong or there is nothing they could do while still looking at my dad. Sorry that just really ticked me off.      In a low background volume area I cannot hear/understand people at all although it has made for some really comical experiences.     I came to terms with the fact that I am going to lose my hearing, I am not too worried about that. What I am worried about is the pain and the constant ringing in my ears. Its like someone stuck a needle in my ear and left it there, once that pain subsides it moves down to the side of my mouth/neck. I am getting constant headaches and dizziness.

      "Missed appointment (due to my fault), now being billed for interpreter fee. Can they do that to me or not? Hello, I'm deaf and has been since I was little and I've moved to a very small, semi-rural town that seems to be stuck about 20-30 years behind in everything. With that said, you can imagine where they are on the ADA law and disabilities, especially deafness and I've been struggling to get the reasonable accommodations that I need in this town. I've asked a lawyer to help me out about 7 times so far for places who refused me reasonable accommodations, three times for one place and this is the very same place that I'm here to ask for advice about. This place is a family medicine facility, where I go to see my family doctor and all and when I first asked them if they were accepting medicare and they were. I also asked for them to provide a qualified interpreter and of course, at first they weren't willing to and told me that I can bring my own. After a lot of legal fighting, they finally gave in and provided one for me. Unfortunately, in return, I got very poor service because the nurse practitioner did not answer all of my questions and basically summed it up by saying I'm fine, nothing to be concerned about. Also the meetings felt rushed because she did not give me time to ask additional questions, she just wanted to get the hell out of the meeting ASAP. Over the course of two years, they have failed to get an interpreter for the appointment about 5 times, maybe more, and I found out that they weren't able to get one \"in time\" after driving all the way to the facility from the other side of town. When I set up the appointment (which was like 1-2 months before the next appointment), I asked them to set up an interpreter IMMEDIATELY and they said they will, yet somehow they managed to not get one \"in time.\" I spoke with the interpreter agency to see if it was true that it is a hard time getting an interpreter \"in time\" and the agency said that if they call one week ahead, they can get one set up, easily. If it was something like 48 hours before the appointment, it may be possible to get one, but most likely not. They eventually asked me to go ahead and set one up in their place, and have the interpreter bill the services to them because of their struggles. I asked the lawyer as well as one of the interpreters who knows the ADA law very well, and both have told me that I am to do NOTHING with setting up interpreters and such. I repeated this to the office manager and he got pissed off because \"it's too much work for me!\" Finally, the reason why I'm here is because I missed an appointment that I did not schedule in my calendar. I saw my family doctor about something that I went to the emergency room for, and she wanted me back for a follow up after I've seen the specialist she recommended to me. The specialist has a very tight schedule and won't be able to see anyone til about 2-3 months later. The follow up appt with my family doctor is 4 weeks, so clearly I had to cancel the follow up appointment. The nurse from this facility emailed me that I have to see the specialist no matter what, before I see my family doctor and she made it sound like she was going to cancel my follow up appointment. So with that said, I did not bother to set up the appointment in my calendar. Two days ago, the follow up appointment went as scheduled and I got an email from the office manager, letting me know that I missed the appointment. I explained that I thought the follow up appointment was canceled since I had to see the specialist before seeing my family doctor and the office manager said OK that's fine, but since you missed the appointment, you have to pay the no-show fee plus the interpreter fee. So now I have a few questions that I'm not sure of what to do at this point: * I'm not saying I refuse to pay, but do they have the right to force the interpreter fee upon me because I did not show up? * Do I have the right to ask for an invoice or receipt showing that they paid for the interpreter because of their past history of not getting an interpreter for the appointment? * Should I ask them to waive the no-show fee since I came to appointments a few times and they didn't get an interpreter for the appointment, which led to cancelling the appointment and wasting my time and gas? * Should I speak with someone higher above the office manager and explain my dilemma? The problem is I can't find a centralized establishment, similar to a headquarter because there are several campuses within 50 miles of each other and I've tried the website and it seems to show that there are no \"centralized/headquarters.\" * They are also forcing me to pay the fees in full before I can see my family doctor again. Please note that this campus is the **ONLY** one out of all campuses that has told me that I have to pay in full before seeing my family doctor (I had a huge bill last year and I asked to see if I can pay in installments and they said it was fine but I still can't see my family doctor before I pay off the bill in full) and I have this feeling they are enforcing this on me only, not everyone else, because they are trying to find a way to get rid of me. * Anything I can do at this point? It is really frustrating for me and I can just switch to another health provider but the other health providers are basically doing the same thing to every deaf individual that request their service and I would go through the same old legal battles with any other facilities, which is why I decided to stick with this one and see what happens. Sorry for the long read, but thanks in advance for reading and I hope to hear some helpful feedback on what my next course of action would be!  \n",

      "9 month old Genetic Test & Hearing Loss My 9 month-old son was given a genetic panel to assess for variants that may be instrumental to his hearing loss. The panel identified two variants. The first was in the MYH14 gene. Apparently variants in this gene can cause hearing loss and neuropathy. This aligns with my son's ABR results and makes sense to me. But the other variant they found was along the TRRAP gene. From my very limited knowledge, it seems variants along this gene produce a wide range of neuro differences -- hearing loss, ID, autism, epilepsy and cancer.  And my son's particular mutation doesn't occur anywhere else in the database...meaning, I presume, he's the only person that has been tested that has this variation. This news scared me. I should also mention that both variants are of \"Unknown Significance.\" So maybe it means nothing? But... who knows. My son seems to be developing typically, but he is very young. I'm wondering if any redditors have a similar experience with freaky genetic test results? I'm very anxious about all of these possibilities. Please help ease my mind if you've dealt with something similar. Our ENT gave us this news in a patient portal (not helping my over anxious sensibilities!)

My audiologist warned me in the past about hearing aid manufacturers discontinuing these, so I decided to try the digital ones now to see if they're any better.Unfortunately, I find myself unable to adjust to them. I've went through the Resound Alera and didn't like it outright. I didn't really get through the first week on that one. Now I'm trying the LinX. My audiologist says to give this one at least two weeks, but I'm quickly thinking about returning it on Monday.My problem is that the sound doesn't sound very authentic at all. While I do like the idea of having an iPhone app help out with the volume control, making calls and streaming music, I find myself wincing at some of the harsh and muffled sounds that I receive. A crowd clapping after a speech sounds like lightbulbs popping in unison. My voice sounds like it went through some unheard of stage of late-adult puberty. In a loud area, I won't hear someone who is standing close to me unless I directly look at them, something that I didn't have trouble with on the analogs. While its not my profession, hearing music and singing is something that I didn't have a problem with before. With the digital hearing-ads, everything sounds flat. Trying to pick out the bass in some songs is like trying to find Waldo (unless I turn up the radio volume, which doesn't help a lot.)I should also point out that even with the volume control on the Resound app, the LinX and the Alera likes to turn the volume down for you. I find this to be incredibly stupid, irritating and frustrating.What I'm hearing in these new digital hearing aids is just bad sound quality. With my audiologist pushing more of these new technological hearing aid advancements on me, full knowing that I'd rather go back to analogs, I'm just wondering why hearing-aid companies and manufactures thought it was a good idea to discontinue what I've been comfortable with all my life?Does anyone have an idea? Who can I contact about this?As far as my analog goes, I'm thinking about buying another PicoForte off of eBay and then having my audiologist make adjustments on them. That way I'll have that one ready to go once my current PicoForte finally breaks or stops working. \n",

      "What happens at Audiology centers It is normal to feel unsure or nervous when visiting an audiology center for the first time. You don’t know what to expect and you might be scared from the result. Many people visit audiologists because their doctors sent them. However, seeing an audiologist is not the same as seeing a doctor. No need to worry as the appointment always has a positive outcome.[ Image Credit: https:\\/\\/lirp.cdn-website.com\\/a3b4d90c\\/dms3rep\\/multi\\/opt\\/stock-photo-mature-woman-getting-a-hearing-test-at-audiology-center-audiometry-hearing-checkup-2003099240-1920w.jpg ]( What happens at your first [hearing test appointment]( **Questions**The appointment usually starts by asking a set of questions. The audiologist starts by discussing your work, lifestyle and the hearing difficulties you are facing. They will ask about any medication you are taking or any allergy, injury or illness they need to know about. This will help them understand what noises you encounter or hear a lot and what complaints you have or what symptoms you’re feeling. It also helps them to know what medications might have side effects on your hearing or might be harming your ears without you knowing. All of these questions are normal and a must. The audiologist will take notes and update the information throughout on the computer, for offering a better diagnosis and providing the most effective treatment.* **Tests**In the hearing test, the audiologist performs many tests to check all possible [causes of hearing loss]( such as ear infections, tinnitus-ringing of the ear, or even vertigo- imbalance caused by problems in the inner and middle ear. Then, there are three main tests that the audiologist runs based on his assumptions:1. [**Otoscopy**]( This is a physical exam where the audiologist checks the ear canal using an “otoscope” and magnifying pen light. They check the buildup of ear wax, any blockage, or problems with the ear canal or ear drum.2. [**Tympanometry**]( The audiologist checks the middle ear and its response to light pressure. This test helps him detect if there is anything stopping motion of your ear drum. This could be due to any certain fluid or infection.3. [**Pure-tone audiometry**]( In this test, you sit in soundproof rooms while wearing headphones. You will be asked to listen to and respond to different tones, voices and speech sounds in different situations. You press a button once you hear a sound or raise your hand, and the responses will be recorded on audiograms, which are graphs that show the quietest level you were able to hear.All of these tests are painless, so no need to worry or panic. After these tests, the [audiologist ]( about your medical and family history.  Based on the result, they can help to indicate if you have a hearing loss problem or not. They usually check wax or fluid build-up, infections or any other abnormality. The test usually takes 45 to one hour. Results are usually instantaneous, and your audiologist will directly share them with you.Sometimes, the audiologist requests getting a relative, friend or someone close to you because some tests include hearing a familiar voice and testing your hearing accordingly. They can also help you to communicate with your audiologist and jot down all the information the audiologist is saying.**What happens after the diagnosis?**Your audiologist will discuss with you his findings, that is what type of hearing loss you have and why and how you had it. They will explain to you the different degrees of hearing loss, ranging from normal to mild, moderate, severe, reaching to profound. They will then tell you what type you have. If they believe there are other medical issues that need to be ruled out, you might be referred to an ENT, who is an ear, nose and throat doctor.Some of the results are shocking to some and that is very common. Some people might not even know they have a hearing problem, and some think their situation was worse. The audiologist will provide you with all the available solutions to manage and cope with your hearing loss. The most common one is hearing aids. Your audiologist will explain about them, their usage and function and which one best suits your condition. They will inform you that they are available in different styles, sizes and technologies and they will discuss all their specifications.  A follow-up session is usually arranged in this case to order and customize the best hearing aid**.**Any medical appointment might be intimidating. If you have an appointment with an audiologist, you now know that it is normal and has nothing to worry about. If you still didn’t schedule an appointment, do that now! \n",

      "Frustrated I (M20) have always had low vision since six months old. Throughout life, it's gotten worse. It has been told in the last year that I'm legally blind, can't drive, etc. I was in art school for a while, but I had to switch paths as my vision worsened. I haven't drawn on paper/canvas since then. I sometimes draw on my iPad, which allows me to zoom in. I tried to pull for the first time in years on paper today. I couldn't do it. I couldn't see. So I just sat there and cried for a minute. It just sucks. I miss it. The stuff I want to draw and have ideas for can't be done digitally. I'm just sad and need to vent. \n",

      "Few Varying Questions -- VS Code, iPhone, Youtube &#x200B;Sorry, several stupid questions that have been bugging me lately.  If you can answer any of them, would be greatly appreciated.&#x200B;1.  Any way to speed up voice in VS Code?  For example, in xed (default Linux Mint text editor) when I hit Ctrl+O to open a file, browsing my filesystem is instant in screen reader.  However, doing the same in VS Code, there's a huge delay and it takes me about 8 times as long to find the file I'm looking for.  Looking through the preferences, and couldn't see anything there.  Any way to give VS Code a little pep so it talks quicker?  &#x200B;2.) On iPhone, when i give Siri a command such as \"read notifications\", it spits back the responses to me at a good rate.  However, when simply tapping the screen it's slow as hell when telling me what I tapped.  Checked Accessibility Options, and speech rate is at 100%.  I remember changing volume with various taps, but can't remember how.  Any help?&#x200B;3.  Where did Youtube comments go?  Previously, I would just need to scroll down a little and press either 2 or E, or if all else failed search for the word \"Comments\", and it was no problem.  Youtube design has changed though, and I simply can no longer find the comments section.  Any tips?&#x200B;Thanks in advance. \n",

      "hearing loss causing problems at my job - looking for advice I have a job at a library. My co-workers know that I am hard of hearing, and realize that I am not \"ignoring\" them if I don't respond. The problem is with the patrons. If I am working in the stacks, they will see me from the computers and start talking to me/asking questions and I won't realize it, especially if my back is turned to them. They think I'm ignoring them and get angry and rude, especially when most of the time it's not something I can help them with and I have to direct them to one of the clerks at the counter.Is there a way to let people know that I'm hard of hearing, short of wearing a sign or something? Not that they'd probably notice or care. I mean, the reason they're shouting me down in the stacks is because they're too lazy to get up and go to the counter for help anyway. If they don't see me out there, then they'll wave their arms in the air trying to get the clerks at the counter to come over to them. TLDR; Patrons get angry when I \"ignore\" them while I'm working. \n",

Now we live in the US and she became Moderatly Hard of Hearing. The doctor doens't know but its progressive but nevermind that. Anyways, With Hearing Aids she understands Hebrew well but she has a difficult time with English and Russian. The issue is that her grandson (My nephew) only speaks english (and is 2 1/2 by the way). She also can't understand people in loud places and doesnt hear when people are asking her questions in restaurants and such. My hebrew is not that great so its hard to have a conversation with her and she is not eligible for CI's either. Do you guys think our family should learn ASL to talk to her when she doesnt understand us? (Im sorry if my grammar is bad im tired and mildly autistic.) \n",

      "Damaged eye from uveitis I have been struggling to find someone who has a similar experience to myself so I am sorry if this may not be the most appropriate place to ask the question.Over 2 years ago I had a bad case of uveitis that lasted over 3 months. It has left the muscle in my eye paralysed and it no longer subtracts to light, leaving me with a large dilated pupil. I also have a lot of iris atrophy, resulting in very severe light sensitivity in this eye. It means I can no longer go outside without strong sunglasses and even then it is uncomfortable on sunny days.I know I am still lucky to have site in this eye and grateful for this however it has got to the stage where I can barely go out the house and I am dreading the summer where I will more than likely be in the house most of the day.As anyone else experienced anything similar ? Or does anyone have any tips dealing with light sensitivity Again I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place, I’m just a bit stuck on where to turn as been told by doctors there is nothing that can be done and I just need to live with it. \n",

      "Tired of people asking me what my diopter is *Warning rant about seeing people ahead*I have low vision that can't be corrected by glasses. My vision is about 20/400. They're not sure what the cause of it is but it's believed to be an issue somewhere between the ciliary muscles, zonules, and lens. I can somewhat see up close to my face enough to read but it's still very difficult. Everything is blurry, hazy, and has 4 copies of itself. This is exactly what I tell people when I explain my visual impairment. And every time I tell this to someone who wears glasses and has a high degree of near sightedness I get the same respone. \"What's your diopter!? Mines *insert super high number*! So I'm blind without glasses too and totally get it!!\"Are you kidding me? What part of, not correctable by glasses doesn't translate? I don't have a diopter measurement because glasses won't fix my vision.It feels like rubbing it in my face that their vision can be corrected and mine can't. Also no they can't relate. Because they put on glasses and are sighted. I don't have that option. Nothing I do allows me to experience the world as a sighted person. It's also so annoying how they brag about how high their diopter. Like they're so visually impaired it makes them so special! As someone who actually can't see, it's not an achievement. Their vision doesn't even affect their life like mine does! But they are trying to prove their so blind just like me. I've even had people say \"Oh my vision is probably worse than yours because my diopter is the highest my doctor has ever seen.\" No it's not. Because they can see fine with glasses. Functionally they have no visual impairment. Functionally I can't see.Seriously, who wants to be the most blind person? I've never felt the need to compete with other blind/VI people to prove I have worse vision. Which is a strange concept because there's lots of different types of visual impairments where what the person sees that causes them to have low vision is different. It's not a straight line from sighted to blind. But they hear \"I can somewhat see up close\" and take that as I'm just severely nearsighted that's the only thing wrong with my vision. Then want to prove they are more blind than me. \n",

      "Any advice on deafblindness? Hi, so, I've always (so far as anyone can tell) been vision impaired. I can roll with that. But recently (this past 5 or 6 months) I've also lost some hearing. It's freaking me out a bit, because frankly, things can be difficult enough with one sense-based disability, never mind two.   It's not like I think my life is over because I've got a hearing loss. I know so many deaf, Deaf, and Hard of Hearing people, and they do all kinds of shit and live the lives they want. It's just the both combined is frankly kind of terrifying. My hearing isn't even that bad (I get 98 % of conversations aimed at me, but miss plenty of background noise) at this point in time, but it's likely I'll lose more (Thanks, menieres).   If anyone has any advice or like, anything they can share I'd really appreciate it. Thanks. \n",

      "So, about the actual Alexander G Bell and deaf people in general.... Why the fuck did he marry a deaf woman, and why did she accept his horrible views on d/Deaf people... I mean, they even procreated, which is sorta funny. As far as I know, she was not culturally deaf but essentially a \"hearing person with deaf ears\", which would be paradoxical to think about as an outsider but here in our world it makes sense. But still... he made so many awful statements towards people who shared her disability, and even those who were not culturally deaf either. How could she separate herself from those people AGB held so much contempt for? Divided views even within deaf people ourselves, like Grandma Dolores who is slightly hard of hearing and doesn't see the point in sign language, to the militant college aged Deaf person who won't even engage in conversation with a hearing person... it's no wonder why social progression with the rest of the world has been so difficult. This is from a deaf young woman who is in a serious relationship with a hearing man, who depends on sign language but also uses spoken speech and used to wear a CI at a young age, who has friends both in and out of the Deaf community. It's a mind fuck to me... what do you think /r/deaf?  \n",

So I've got my hearing aids in now and to adjust better at work I asked if I was allowed to attached magnets on to two of the work phones (In reception and out the back). I was given the okay.That day my coworker was on the phone and basically threw a huge tantrum because the magnets \"are so annoying honestly, you have no idea how much it hurts your ear to have a magnet just constantly sitting there, I was on the phone for 30mins and I swear by the end of it my ear was so sore. I'm moving the phone with the magnet to the back and now that is your phone so leave the reception phone alone cause I don't want magnets on there.\"So I moved the phone back because for half the day I also work in reception and need that phone. She threw another fit \"Can't you move the magnet to the back of the phone? Seriously this is ridiculous I can't answer the phone properly without getting sore ears\".When I said, I get sore ears from having something jammed in them all day she said \"Hey I'm not trying to make a big deal but see it from my side for once\".So now I have to carry around the phone all day so the magnets dont annoy her.I feel a little upset because they're pea sized, smooth magnets that sit over your ear. I don't want to be carrying around a phone all day just in case it rings and I'm the one who has to answer. Does anyone have advice on how to move forward with this situation?

I apparently won the genetic lottery(Eustachian tubes are too small to allow fluid to pass through), since my parents and teachers noticed I wasn't hearing as well as I should it created a roller coaster. I have been through a slew of tubes, T-tubes, tubeoplasties, and one sugery recently that I cant remember the name of. I am now in my mid twenties because of the roller-coaster of fun that I went through the auditory processing part of my brain along with the speech part of my brain is extremely messed up. Those two parts of my brain are so messed up that I have a hard time speaking, and hearing. These past few years have gotten worse in the sense that my hearing is degrading. The most recent surgery that I had is supposed to bring it back to \"normal\" in a year (I have had a surgery like this before and it did not work), but the other ear is still tweaking and has lost most of the lower frequencies (unless they are boosted/I can feel the lower frequencies). All of my hearing frequencies charts show a deterioration of 10 decibels between 2010 to 2014.I started taking an ASL class and now I am wondering if I am part of deaf culture. I mean this in no disrespect to anyone, I just am curious if I am part of deaf culture.

I just wanted to say that it makes me *extremely* angry when I see deaf children with families who do not sign to them.

Just the other day somebody here on reddit attempted to say they \"understood\" what their 12 year old profoundly deaf daughter was going through yet \"soundly rejected\" learning sign language because, apparently, *\"only the deaf use it\"*. Obviously that statement is not true, and even if it was, did this person forget that their daughter was deaf? I live in a part of the US where there are many hispanics and mexicans. The deaf community here is bass-ackwards. They speak/lip read spanish and sign in ASL. A deaf lady came into my store with this older hispanic woman. Older woman started started speaking to me in Spanish, which is the language I am currently learning, but I felt more comfortable signing. While doing so, the elderly mother checked out. I asked her daughter, who was about 30, if her mother ever learned ASL. The answer was no.What. The. Hell.Yes, nearly everybody speaks a spoken language. To BAN learning a language just because \"the deaf\" are the only one who use it is a shady excuse at best.

The first hearing test was done for free by a private audiology company in the UK (amplifon) and no such thing as in the title was said at all. My most recent hearing test was done by an NHS (public healthcare) audiologist where they said to beep the button even if you *think* you've heard something but not sure if you did. I've mentioned this to other people and they think it doesn't sound right (mainly hearing people I've told this to). The NHS did this test before me being referred to hearing therapy and I did what I was told to do for 4 months every day or so and had no results. I even largely reduced my closed caption usage so I wouldn't just be reading. The hearing therapist said there's nothing they can give me to help but I do know that some people get hearing aids for auditory processing issues if that's solely the case for me due to my history.

My little sister is 15 years my junior, and has always had bad eyesight. When she first learned how to walk, she would get up in the middle of the night and walk into walls. Shortly after, she started to go cross-eyed, so we took her to the opthometrist. She has had thick, thick glasses since she was 3 or 4, probably. Today, she was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, which (as far as we know) means she will eventually be blind. This is devastating news, and even though we haven't been to the specialist yet, we are preparing for the worst. Here's why I came here: - Have you or a family member gone blind at a young age, and how did your family tell you? How did you feel? I want her to know that we support her in the fullest, and I don't want her to feel scared or alone. We have not told her anything yet. - Do you know anyone with RP and is there anything you can share about the disease? We've been reading stuff all morning, but any information helps.- Anything else you think would be helpful information to know would be greatly appreciated.

OF COURSE I DIDNT. I CANT FUCKING HEAR. I signed it because I was so absolutely dumbfounded and upset that I might have had a meltdown in the middle of the store. I left the store in tears and went home to have the aforementioned meltdown.What do I do? This isnt fair and I feel absolutely hopeless. I'm in a small town so jobs are few and far between.Lastly, any other stories like this? How did you respond?edit: The. The title was supposed to say the. Sorry, I'm still shaking like a moron. \n",

      "Hearing aid or no hearing aid? Please help. Hello,I was hoping to get some advice on whether or not I should get a hearing aid.I have pain and tinnitus in both ears, and mild hearing loss in my right ear. The loss is neuro-sensoral and will not come back. The loss is about five decibels and on the very low end of \"normal\" hearing. The range I have lost is mostly mid/conversational tones. I'm in graduate school and struggle to keep up with lectures and conversations. I miss a lot of conversation. Sometimes I don't hear cars coming or people walking behind me, which concerns me as I live in a major city. It's impacting my daily life is what I'm getting at. THE PROBLEM: My doctor said I will not benefit from hearing aids, \"unless I want to drop a couple thousand dollars.\" I'm not sure what that means. He's actually a massive jerk that doesn't listen to me, but he's a specialist, and the eighth doctor I've seen, so I'm pretty tired of bouncing around. He does not know what caused my hearing loss, whether it will get worse, and how quickly it would get worse.I'm looking for opinions on whether or not I should get a hearing aid. I have prescriptions for the pain and migraines, but it will make no difference to the loss I already experience. Thoughts and opinions are welcome. Thank you for reading! \n",

      "I think I have APD This is already in r/AudiProcDisorder , but I wanted to reach more people. Let me know if this isn't allowed though.  I'm putting the flair Deaf/HOH w/ questions as it's probably the closest fit&nbsp;So a few months ago I learned about APD. Some days I'm certain I have at least mild APD, other days I'm certain I'm faking. I can't really get a good opinion from anyone in my life, and I'm debating to seek a diagnosis. so I wanted to hear your judgement on whether I should or not, or any advice you have&nbsp;-I'll hear small sounds other people can't at times, but other times I won't notice someone talking to me-One-on-one conversations are very easy, especially if I know they're likely to say something-In classrooms, I can still manage, but it's more likely for me to miss out on small things at least once an hour (from what I notice). -It's surprisingly easy to tune out people's conversations in classrooms, maybe because everyone's quiet? -in other environments it becomes much more difficult, especially when it's not familiar/not a place I go to often. It's hard to even hear in a quiet store sometimes.-I often say \"what\", and some of these times it clicks a few seconds after.-I often mishear words or lyrics, and miss out on small things people say. All the weird things people say they hear accidentally - VERY relatable. -Whenever someone talks to me without having my attention, I miss out on what they say. -I'm also very bad with verbal directions and have often heard \"haha our child has selective hearing\" from my parents. Plus I'll hear some instructions wrong as well-i always immediately turn on subtitles. If I have subtitles I can usually hear everything that is said, otherwise it depends. People have made faces at me before for turning them on, or said \"we've watched this so much, why do you need them?\" I turn them on anyways-i memorize lyrics very easily so once I know them, I can hear all the lyrics very easily. Otherwise it's hit is miss-Twice Ive heard a random language, and of course didn't understand a thing. I assumed it was English, and then went into the comments. -I get tired after watching long videos without subtitles, even if it's clear. As an example:One day we watched a video in history for at least an hour and I was exhausted afterwards (first class of that day). I zoned out for about 10 minutes in the middle, because my brain needed a break. Then I had English in the afternoon. We ended up watching many informational videos that class as well, and I was too tired to process the audio. I asked my teacher for subtitles, but then realized that the exhaustion had affected my reading as well. Most of everything went over my head.&nbsp;Music: I enjoy music a lot. I can tell the subtle things in music when I do hear it - but I can't tell what note anything is. I play the piano. -Often If I'm listening to music in public, or as background noise, I'll only notice the song halfway through. Usually when it gets loud, distinctive, triggers noticable synesthesia, or is at the chorus.-Speaking of synesthesia, there's something for that too. My synesthesia is... Difficult to explain, but it's caused by audio. And sometimes I don't hear the audio, but I still get the synesthesia. So I'll sense that and be really confused and search for a sound around me. I also use it to identify specific sounds. Of course there's bound to be similar things, so sometimes I'll misidentify them due to only that. They'll sound completely different, but because of only being able to process my synesthesia, I'll mix it up. Happens a lot with songs.&nbsp;Also some notes about talking and speech:-I only started talking (besides small words) when I was 3 1/2. It was very sudden as well - apparently I just started talking one day and would not stop. And I have distinct memories of reading before that time. So I knew English but didn't speak it- I'm not sure if it's because I just didn't want to or for something else-Until 2nd or 3rd, I struggled with my Rs. They'd sound like Ws, according to my family. I also struggled with a couple more letters, but much less than R. I never really heard it then though. Now it occasionally will slip through.-i struggle to find the words I want a lot.&nbsp;None of this is constant, 24/7, but definitely happens at least a few times a day. Some days are worse than others, and it gets worse when I'm stressed out.&nbsp;I'm sorry this got so long... I wanted to put everything I could think of. I want to know if I should consider a diagnosis or if it's unnecessary I guess. Thank you so much :)Also I probably won't respond for a while, it's late and I have school tomorrow.&nbsp;Edit: formatting \n",

      "Advice for helping a blind resident at an Assisted Living facility? Hello! I'm a Caregiver at an Assisted Living facility which services people with mild dementia and Alzheimer's. There is a resident I work with who seems to have gone nearly completely blind a year or so ago. She lives on a floor with ten other residents, none of whom are blind. She gets left out from activities and seems to have been left pretty much on her own in navigating the experience of going blind. She isn't able to access the internet by herself and she doesn't get the help to do so. She's lonely, scared, and has been left without resources regarding her blindness. Obviously, this is in large part a consequence of the shortcomings of the facility and management itself. I am trying to figure out the most realistic and sustainable way I can help her. I personally have not known anyone blind, and have no experience with vision loss at all. Would anyone have any advice or thoughts on where I should start to look for resources for her? What are the first steps that those who recently lost their vision tend to take to find resources to navigate the experience?Thank you. \n",

      "What was your experience with mainstreaming? Growing up, my parents decided to mainstream me because “the world will not adapt for you, you have to adapt to the world”. Now, I have a deaf daughter. Her hearing loss is currently mild but if it progresses like mine, she’ll be completely deaf by the time she’s in her twenties. Now I’m faced with the choice of mainstreaming her or enrolling her in deaf school. Enrollment in deaf school means moving, which is fine. I’m struggling because while I want her to be able to talk and get along with hearing people, I don’t want her to struggle like I did with feelings of isolation. I’ve also read that mainstreamed children have a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and substance abuse. I’m coming to this subreddit to ask for your experience with mainstreamed education versus deaf school. I struggle to know what the right decision to make is and have a shortage of deaf people in my life to talk to about this. \n",

      "Multilingualism I have only recently discovered this community and I am so happy to have found you guys! Anyway, I am a linguistics student from Sweden and deaf from birth. I sign and Svenskt teckenspråk is my first language. My parents are English and Swedish respectively. They (and my siblings) are hearing and it is the law in Sweden that if your kid is deaf, you have to learn STS. I know quite a lot of BSL and can read, write and speak quite well in both spoken languages, albeit with a \"Deaf accent.\"None of this has ever, ever, ever been a problem for me until tonight when a group of people were talking to me. I have residual hearing, but I sign in Swedish sign language as I talk, I can't help it. Some hearing guy said to me \"So, what is it like not having any language?\" and assumed I had learning disabilities, and I just started to  cry.... Normally this wouldn't phase me, but I'm so sick of this shit. I would actually say that I speak four languages. But I am just so sick of people not seeing signing as a language, and so many people are shocked when I say I study linguistics.. So little of the subject area and research is about hearing - people who are into hearing science (or whatever it would be called) go into SLT and audiology. I got a great grade in phonetics and I can't fucking hear. I'm sorry for an angry post, I know that I'm lucky to have not had to deal with so many assholes, but I just got a bit sad.Edit: A million edits for words. \n",

      "My cochlear implant has given up Some context, I was born with no issues, but when I was about a year old, my dad decided I could \"tough it out\" without the meningitis shot for a while for whatever reason.Lo and behold meningitis came and wiped out all of my hearing cells and something to do with my teeth, which I'm not clear on still aside from the fact I've always had to have work done on my teeth until I was 18.I got my first cochlear implant when I was a year and a half old. They were immensely expensive (year was 1995) and 100% guaranteed to last my whole lifetime. Pay attention to this. This comes into play later.I was very good at hearing and socialising with the CI throughout my life, but for whatever reason, they decided to get me a second CI for my left ear when i was 12 (year was 2006). It was terrible. I couldn't make out words, sounds, or anything with the left CI alone it just.. Echoed. With both of them on, it just made sound unnecessarily loud and very annoying, causing me migraines. Regardless, parents, teachers, audiologist, and surgeon urged that I keep using the left CI. 2 years later, I decided enough was enough and stopped wearing the left CI. It was useless to me, and nobody believed me that it worked. After all, they can't hear what I can hear, so surely their opinion is more believable? Whatever. Fast forward 15 years later (year was 2021), the surgeon admitted that my left CI was faulty, and they messed up. I wondered why it took them 15 years to admit their fuck up. It was so I couldn't sue them, apparently. Now, the real pain begins in late 2021. I usually wore headsets to listen to music and my video games with no issue, but I started getting loud screeching feedback. This happened 3 times in a row before the current audiologist said there was nothing they could do to fix my external or mapping. This is when I realise headsets have magnets inside them and probably what the cause was. So I began using Bluetooth wireless and noticed the hearing was not so bad when I had the music on mute and was able to hear somewhat alright. Eventually, in early 2022, my the muffling effect from the Bluetooth that helped me tolerate hearing stopped working and all I could hear every time anyone talked, any sound was made even the wind while driving to work became a high pitched screeching that would 100% guaranteed cause me a migraine. Again, nobody believed me. So I stopped wearing my CI for 16 months now while fighting with my work insurance, denying me at every twist and turn for a CI surgery for the new one because after all my 100% guaranteed lifetime CI was, well, not going to last a lifetime. I looked for grants, gofundme, anything to help me get this surgery to happen. I have been talking to a vocational rehabilitation agency for the last 9 months trying to get my surgery. To say they were helpful is an understatement. Granted, I am not paying them to do their job, the government is. But it feels like I am doing their job for them every time. From gathering my medical records, surgery estimates, and walking into hospitals expecting me to talk to the employees for information they need while I am DEAF. I am currently waiting for their financial coordinator to get back to them to let me know whether or not my 5 options for funding would be enough for surgery. 16 months and counting being deaf after using CI for 28 years of my life when I was supposed to have surgery 14 months ago but denied, despite being put on high priority for surgery has been putting a massive strain on my friendship, family, work mentality or psyche whatever you want to call it.At work people get angry at me because I cannot be efficient, fast, or understand them so they deem me as stupid and cuss me out when they forget that I can read lips and if I were to notify my manager about their behaviour she just tells me that she does not believe me because I cannot hear them and I am probably just misunderstanding them. And no, I may not record them spewing profanities at me because it is against company ToS.Friends do not talk to me anymore because I do not use the mic while gaming because I cannot game and they can't be bothered to type out messages, I guess.Parents are always shouting at me to listen to them or if I understand them despite being deaf and the fact they could just text me. I still live with them at 29 years old because there is no way I could live on my own. I can barely wake up on my own with 5 heavy-duty vibrating bed alarms.Many times, I have contemplated dark matters because I don't know how to cope or what to do when the VR just keeps making me do their job for them to no end or results. I can't even get grants or anything to help me because they are aimed at under 18 or over 60 year olds. I came to this subreddit to see if anyone had an alternative to listening to music again or a fix to my problem, and so far, I have found nothing. All I can do is hope the surgery comes soon like I always do every 2 months, resist the malicious thoughts, and hope against everything the surgery is not a failure./rant, I guess, over \n",

The articles about a blind man who wants a concealed carry permit because he's been attacked several times in Baltimore. I'll try to sumerize what I can remember from what my friend told me, because I really want this article for various reasons. - a blind man was walking through a bad neighbourhood to his baltimore home- his cane bumped a mans leg who proceeded to accuse him of being a \"disrespectful cracker\" and stap and rob him.- later in a different bad area in Baltimore he's walking with his guide dog and someone shoots and robs him and shoots and kicks his dog leaving the poor dog unable to walk. - the rest of the article was about his attempt to get a gun permit- I don't know how much of this is in the article, and how much is my friend misremembering which is why I want the article to find out for myself. This worries me because Baltimore is supposed to be one of the best cities in America for the blind and visually impaired.

      "I'm a college student who befriended a blind student on campus. I led a campaign to raise $10,000 to pay for his guide dog expenses. Twice since then the dog was reclaimed by the guide dog school. What should I do? I'm an undergrad student and I became friends with a fellow student on my campus. We'll call him Mike. He is blind and came back to college in 2012 to finish his undergrad (he's in his 40's). In 1997, he was struck by a drunk driver who fled the scene. He became completely blind, and has difficulty with balance and orientation, and also suffers from PTSD.Two years ago I asked Mike why he didn't have a guide dog, and he told me that he was working on the extensive application process of getting approved for one. He told me that one of the application requirements was demonstrating to the guide dog school the ability to pay for related expenses of owning a dog. i.e., food, medical, dental expenses, etc.My fraternity and I raised $10,000 to help this student with his guide dog expenses. He soon after got a guide dog from Guide Dogs of the Desert in Palm Springs in April 2015. This was shortlived however as after just a few weeks of having the dog at university, the dog was reclaimed because Mike was reported to be wandering into busy streets. In Jan. 2016, Mike got another dog from the Eye Dog Foundation in Arizona. However again, Mike only had the dog for another few weeks before trainers determined to bring the guide dog back to the facility, due to the dog excessively barking, and challenging other dogs and people. Mike tells me that he believes the main issue is that he and the dog are trained in quiet and easy to navigate areas, but then the dog gets stressed out and confused when he completes initial training and returns to our busy college campus with lots of people. Combine this with Mike's distorted orientation and PTSD from the accident, and I see how navigating blind with a dog can be difficultSo we're back at square one, applying to a different guide dog school. The money is still in the non-profit account that I opened. Is there anything else I can do? I'm worried the next dog will be the same story. What should I do with all this money? If it doesn't work out again, should I just donate it to a guide dog school?[Here is a link to the article]( \n",

      "Does anyone else have neural hearing loss? I don't see this being mentioned much online.  But, here goes.My inner ear and outer ear is perfectly fine, if you only judge them both you'd say I have perfect hearing.  The nerves (yes the actual nerves that criss crossing your brain) connecting my ears to the brain are badly damaged.  Sound goes in fine, but my brain can't comprehend it, since I'm guessing that the sound waves gets lost somewhere.Any way, I have 60dB to 65 dB bone conduction loss.  I never get tested for Air conduction 'cause my audiologist says it's a waste of time since I'll always have 100% loss, so what he would do is 'copy' my bone conduction onto my air conduction, so if Bone is 62dB, air is also 62dB, there's no difference.He wasn't the only one to do that though, other audiologists do that.  They all say that I'm ineligible for Cochlear implants because there's nothing wrong with my ears, it's a nerve issue.  I got my hearing loss due to being overdosed on anti-biotics when I needed emergency heart surgery as a baby.  So yeah my left side is weaker than a normal persons, and I do have lazy eye, and my left side does get numb after putting weight or stress on it.  Overall it's fine, but like I told my husband, if he's hanging on a cliff and only my left arm is free, he's dead because my arm would be useless in a matter of seconds once heavy weight is on it.  Most people have some strength with their left, I don't.  Working them out does nothing unfortunately.Any way, sorry I went off on a tangent.  I understand I have an unusual situation, but I can't be the only one with neural/central neural system damage right?  BTW, I've been told that it's a miracle only my hearing got lost, it could've been worse like me being paralyzed or a vegetable for life. \n",

      "How AMC Stole Christmas Here is a post I shared on my movie podcast website, dragonreel.com about trying to go see a movie today. I'm still upset about it. Theaters have to train their employees. There's no reason for this to keep happening.I’ve been in tears over this several times today. My husband and I are fans of science fiction and fantasy, and for years, we’ve shared this hobby together. I was a kid when Star Wars came out for the first time, and I’ve always loved the movies.For a Christmas surprise, he got us tickets to see the new Star Wars movie at a time when they offered audio description. There were only two such shows during the day, and the morning showing on Christmas day seemed to be the best chance that we could avoid overcrowded theaters and make sure we got the right headset for audio description.The introduction of audio description in movie theaters was such a wonderful advancement, and made me so happy when our local theaters added it to their list of services. I have had terrible anxiety about going to movie theaters ever since I went to see the LAST Star Wars movie: Revenge of the Sith. My daughter was quietly describing the action on the screen, and the woman next to her kept tapping her and shushing her. Then my husband, sitting on my other side, took over describing, and the woman glared at us, even though it was impossible for her to hear him describing. After the movie, she yelled at us, and at me in particular, and called me a bitch for ruining her movie experience, even after we explained that I was totally blind. She said that if I needed someone to talk to me during the movie, I should just stay home. That experience has stayed with me for a decade and colored my expectations of going out to the movies.When we got to AMC, we went straight to a manager, who flagged down a girl working there to give us the headset. We specifically asked if it was audio description, as opposed to enhanced audio for the hearing impaired. She assured us it was, but that it wouldn’t start working until the movie started. So we got into the theater and waited.I don’t think I need to describe the anticipation we felt, but when the long-awaited words “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…” came onto the screen, the headphones were silent. And with the opening crawl of words, there was no reading from the headphones. When my husband started to describe things on the screen, I heard sound in the headphones, but it was only amplified sounds of the events on the screen. No description. No narration.We left the theater and angrily complained to management. Yes, we got our money back after it took 20 minutes to explain the situation and for them to realize what they’d done and get the right headset, and then they offered to let us back in with the right equipment. What good is that? We’ve missed the whole first part of the movie! There was no other showing with audio description for 7 more hours. We weren’t going to come back at 6pm when our daughter is coming over for dinner with our 2-month old grandson!This was not the first time this has happened to us. The many many times we’ve tried to go out to a movie, there has not been one single instance where they gave us the right equipment the first time. And I can only think of two times where we caught their mistake in time to enjoy the movie. I have complained to management each and every time, in at least 3 different theaters in our community. Every time, they have promised to train their employees better in the future. And every time, we get the same ignorance of disability accommodations.I wonder if anyone else with disabilities has experienced such difficulties at AMC theaters in particular, or movie theaters in general. What do you do and how do you explain to them what you need BEFORE it’s too late to enjoy the movie? This was such a nice surprise from my husband, and it turned into such a heartbreak on Christmas. We’re going to try again in a couple days, but how does everyone else get past this barrier?Sharon Dudley, NBCTEDIT: (12/26/2015) Followup this morning. AMC called us, insisted we asked for the wrong thing, as if a blind person doesn't know what equipment to ask for. When we said it was a training issue, she got offended, said \"our people are trained\" and that they would have given me the right thing if I asked for it. She said we were insulting her, and threatened to terminate the call. Sharon was polite through the entire thing trying to deflect blame from the person she was talking to up to the obviously insufficient training process, but the caller would not accept that AMC had erred in any way. So, if they didn't steal Christmas, they did give away our business.EDIT: (12/27/2015) We took the advice of some of the people who responded to this message, and called ahead to Cinemark. We got a manager who not only assured us that she understood the request, but who agreed to sit beside us when the movie came on and make sure it was working correctly. We got to see the movie because people were willing to listen, and because employees had been trained in providing these services. \n",

      "Hi! I (19nb) recently went from visually impaired to mostly blind. Not really sure what to do I’ve been a glaucoma suspect since 2015 and got diagnosed officially in 2021, a bit after I turned 18. There was a gap in time where I stopped seeing my optometrist due to lack of transportation, so I’m not sure when being a suspect turned into having it. They said both of my eyes had damage, and I had glaucoma, but not much more than that. But! With drops I was stable, and things were good. Until my pharmacy refused to refill my latanaprost prescription for two weeks. During this time my pressure was really high, and my eyes felt like they were always on the verge of pushing out of my head. I called my doctor, and suddenly half an hour later I had my prescription! The blind spots and tunnel vision didn’t go away. They checked and my pressure is down again!! I can see changes in light and different colors but I have no peripheral. With my glasses I can function at work okay and make it to the bus stop. But I’ve been following the same routine for the past year and a half so I don’t know how fluid I’d be doing anything else. If anybody here became suddenly blind or just like young adult blind people, what did you do? Like how did you cope?TLDR: Have glaucoma, specialist didn’t explain anything because she assumed I already knew. I had no access to my prescription for 2 weeks. Lost a lot of my vision and was in pain. Pressure stabilized, vision loss stayed. Not really sure what I should do? Not looking for medical advice just like resources or how to cope with sudden vision loss at a young(ish) age \n",

      "Does anyone find it impossible to post to a lot of other subreddits? I am visually impaired, I can see with magnification but, as other VI folks know you can only really see a small bit of a page at a time with magnification. I use a screenreader too at the same time but there are some subs with such strict rules that it seems impossible to post to them! I feel like the automod keeps rejecting posts and there are often so many rules on a sidebar that somehow I keep not seeing or hearing? Then I post and I violated a rule I missed, then I try reposting and there's ANOTHER rule I missed somehow. I'm talking about \"discussion\" posts and not comments.Is this a problem for other blind or visually impaired people? I am for real trying this on multiple platforms - iPad, iPhone, macbook, and my work android. I'm using different screen readers too. It's so annoying, it makes me feel like I'm a bad listener or something... \n",

      "Hi all! I have a deaf friend who has been blaming the fact that he is unintelligent on that fact that he is deaf. I'm curious of any thoughts on the matter. (Story in description) So my friends is 27 years old. He repeatedly says \"Oh people think I'm dumb but I'm just deaf\". Some of the things that he doesn't understand are really shocking for someone his age. HE told me recently, after telling him that I used birth control pills after he asked if I take medicine, that he might give them a try soon. He was being completely serious and was shocked when I told him they were for women only. He does not know what a GPA is, even though he went to a normal high school, and a college program. I currently have the flu, and upon telling him I was dizzy, he said I was probably just drunk or drank too much. He said the flu and being drunk are the same thing. He was also shocked when I said that was not the case. In addition to this, I say words like \"indeed\" or \"absolutely\" and he has no idea what they mean. There's a lot of other things, but I won't go into detail. Basically I am just curious if this is just a complete cop out or not? I know quite a few deaf people that are just as intelligent as anyone else, and have no problem grasping things. I've never met a deaf person other than him who uses his condition as an excuse for the many many things he doesn't know. What's up with this?!EDIT: I know that him using being deaf as an excuse is absolutely not correct. I just want to know what you guys think of the situation. Just clearing that up! \n",

      "Since the inner ear stereocilia (sound detecting cells) are what make us breathe, does this mean that noise-induced hearing loss could be fatal? In 2007, a team of 5 scientists patented a device which measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood of people born with deafness in one or both ears.The device sends an alarm if these levels get out of range during sleep.These scientists patented this device after they noticed 31 people born with deafness in their right ear suddenly died during sleep.In the 2007 patent, the scientists said that the inner ear stereocilia (sound-detecting cells) are the respiratory chemoreceptors of the body, and damage to these sound detecting cells will cause fatal respiratory dysfunction during sleep, similar to what is seen in Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (Ondine's Curse).They confirmed this hypothesis on studies in mice in 2011-2013. They injected an ototoxic antibiotic into the ears of one set of mice. They made a startling discovery - the mice who were now deaf suffered severe respiratory abnormalities, while the control mice did not. The deaf mice lost 98% of their autonomic respiratory drive.These mouse studies were done by the same team of 5 scientists who created the 2007 patent. In press releases, they concluded that these inner ear stereocilia are indeed respiratory chemoreceptors, and several audiology websites picked up on this fact. \n",

      "Emotionally adjusting to new loss of vision Hello friends! I am a 20-year-old with severe myopia who experienced a retinal detachment last year in my right eye. The surgery was so painful and emotionally stressful, and unfortunately, the detachment was severe enough that I only regained partial vision (I am functionally blind in my right eye now). Now, my total vision is noticeably blurrier, and I find myself really struggling with certain tasks. When I learned that my vision was my new normal, I did not let myself be upset because I still had my other eye and knew other people had it worse. However, recently, I have found myself so depressed and frustrated every time I am reminded that this is my new normal. Since I can still drive during the day, (not at night), and do other essential tasks unassisted, it is easy for me to think that other people have it worse and I shouldn't complain. I feel way too young for this to be happening. I have frequent nightmares where something happens to my good eye, and I am completely blind. Thank for listening to my rant: I just feel isolated and like no one my age understands this struggle. \n",

      "Using NFC Tags to enable the visually impaired. Hey everyone,I've been working with museums to provide affordable, independent aural resources for the blind. My solution is NFC Tags & NFC Cards that can be programmed to youtube videos that provide an audio description of paintings or artworks throughout the exhibits. I'd like your feedback and your opinions. [Here is the link to my NFC Business Card kickstarter.]( blind smartphone user I've been in contact with uses the tags to label his medicine bottles. Using the TalkBack feature on Android when you scan a NFC Tag it can playback plain text. For instance, when he scans the medicine bottle his phone reads back \"THIS IS ADVIL...NOT BLEACH\".The experience is as follows:1. Blind user scans NFC Tag2. Audio plays saying \"NEW TAG SCANNED\"3. User taps the top of the screen and the programmed text is played back.I have an exhibit that will be on display at this event.

      "How do we help our dad come to terms with gradual hearing loss? Hi everyone! My sister and I are looking for some advice on a conversation with our (reluctant) dad about his gradual hearing loss.Our dad is in his late 50s and has always been hard of hearing. He is almost fully deaf on his left ear and has difficulties hearing on right ear. Over the last 5 years his hearing has gotten a lot worse. He’s almost always completely lost in group conversations, and have trouble keeping up in one-on-one conversations too. This is a somewhat new thing, and has made us aware that he’s losing hearing relatively quickly.We love our dad to bits, but he’s so stubborn and has never been one for talking about feelings and problems. He’s also reluctant to admit that he’s hearing is getting worse, and that it now, as a opposed to before, actually is causing him problems.  We want to talk to him about this - talk about our options both now and long term. We mostly worry that he’ll lose his hearing completely and that we won't be prepared for it. For us, it’s all about establishing ways now to keep communicating if (and realistically, when) his hearing continues to worsen. We want to talk to him about our options for trying out hearing aids or maybe looking into sign language or something else as a long term option. The main issue, we think, is to get him to accept and see this new reality - both now and long term. We could really use some insight from someone who understands his point of view. Is there something we could say or do that will make it easier for him to come to terms with this? What can we say? What shouldn't we say? We are pretty concerned with not making it sound like we blame him -  We know that this is something that we've unintentionally done in the past - never really realizing how hurtful it must be when his kids moan about him not being able to hear what we say. Thanks so much for your time and input! tl;dr; Our dad is losing hearing - how do we help him come to terms? \n",

However, there’s one more reason why I’ve been putting it off & that reason is freaking EYE DROPS!!! I know its really stupid but I am  a complete baby when it comes to the eye drops 😂 if you’ve ever seen the part on Teen Mom where Chelsea takes her daughter to the eye doctor & then she freaks out during the eye drop process, that’s me 😂 ok, I don’t freak out that bad, atleast not out loud but on the inside i am & on the outside I’m pretty sure i end up blinking all of the eye drops out, if they can get them in to begin with. I try so hard to keep my eyes open & not blink so much but I guess a part of my brain detects this process as some form of torture 😂 PLEASE tell me I’m not the only one!& does anyone have any suggestions to make the process easier? Not only for my sake but also for the poor soul who has to put up with me when they administer the torture drops \n",

      "My daughter had a terrible year physically and I’m worried about her mental stability My daughter (16F) had a terrible 2022 from a physical standpoint. Last January she broke three fingers after her brother (12F) accidentally closed a car door on her hand. In June we were at a wedding and she sprained her right knee after someone pushed her and her heel got stuck in-between an opening of a pedestrian bridge and in July she broke the same three fingers again after getting her hand stuck in the bathroom door.Those three incidents are bad but manageable. September is where she had really bad luck. My daughter is partially deaf. She developed an ear infection when she was 2 months old and it resulted in loss of hearing in 80% of her left ear and 30% in her right ear. She’s worn a hearing aid her whole life and is understandably a little self conscious of it at times. We were afraid she would lose more of her hearing and it unfortunately happened. The same infection my daughter had as a toddler returned in July and she ended up losing all hearing in her left ear by September. My daughter is a strong person but she was a little emotional when she found out. Thankfully, her health insurance covers 75% of the costs of a cochlear implant so she is in line to get one.THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER SHE FOUND OUT SHE IS DEAF IN ONE EAR, SHE TEARS HER ACL AND MCL LIGAMENTS. She plays volleyball for her high school and one of her teammates fell into her knee and tore it up. She had surgery the next week and her recovery has been going well but my wife and I have noticed a change in her. She has been a lot more quiet since tearing her ACL and has been a lot more irritable. She had purple highlights but dyed her hair back to all black and stays in her room all day.On Friday, my daughter might have reached her breaking point. We went to the doctors to get a check-up for her ears and they told us her surgery to get a cochlear implant was postponed until may. This the fourth time her surgery has been pushed back and we are starting to lose patience. She has told me how difficult it’s been for her to hear in class and she feels like an outsider because she can’t hear what her friends are talking about. She has her hearing aid but it’s been giving all sorts of problems recently so she barely uses it outside of class. My daughter did not say anything and walked out of the room and out the hospital door.She wasn’t waiting by the car when I walked out of the hospital but I saw her sitting on a nearby bench. it was raining so I ran and got her back in the car. I asked her if she was okay but she didn’t respond and was quiet the whole ride home. As I pulled into the driveway I heard some sniffling so I turned to my daughter and she was starting to cry. I asked her again if she was okay but she told me not to look at her and ran into the house and locked herself in her bedroom and I have barely seen her since Friday. She stayed in her room all weekend and only left to use the restroom and get some to eat early in the morning and late at night so we don’t see her. My wife and I are worried about her. She wasn’t able to play volleyball which we know had a big impact on her but more importantly she’s taking her hearing loss extremely hard. Outside of class she can barely hear us speaking and her tone of voice is becoming higher to compensate for her deafness which is causing to talk even less than she normally does. I have heard crying from her room multiple times this weekend but my wife and I will be yelled at to go away if we knock on her door. I’ll try and have a conversation with her tomorrow but I’m deeply worried for her mental state. \n",

      "I think apples recent iOS update made the accessibility settings even more glitchy than they already were. I use the speech controller constantly, however, I’ve noticed recently sometimes the “speak on touch“ function  goes dead for no reason and the only way to fix it is to shut down and reboot my iPad. Which gets pretty obnoxious due to how frequently it happens.The voice dictation is also much worse now too.  They updated it so now it tries to fill in punctuation marks for you, however, it literally always does it incorrectly. I try and go back to fix the mistakes, however, simply tapping around the error always ends up selecting a whole phrase due to the dotted line underneath it. Not to mention, just simple word recognition has gotten so much worse for some reason.Basically what I’m getting at is, the whole things become much more finicky, and a bigger pain in the ass. And considering I use this stuff constantly, it’s very obnoxious. i’ve even had to do it several times while making this post.Has anyone else experienced some thing similar recently?

My hearing seems as bad as it was before I got a hearing aid. I can't understand most of what people are saying.I don't know if this can be because my ears are blocked but they really don't feel it, they we're check recently and weren't blocked at all. Could it be my hearing aid? Or could I have lost more hearing in this time? For context: I have single sided hearing loss with moderate-severe hearing loss in my right ear, my left ear is fully hearing. I wear a hearing aid in my right ear, I've had it since early September and had my earmold and hearing aid programmed and checked.

      "DAE have irrational thoughts about dying because you're deaf? I know this sounds completely insane, but sometimes my brain goes into overdrive and i think about how i could die because I'm deaf. I'm a night owl and go to bed really late, partly because i like the alone time, but mostly to keep watch. It's like i get this thing in my head that tells me \"Stay awake in case of intruder\" which is weird because we lock our doors every night but in the back of my mind i always think what if they bust through a window and i can't hear it because I'm asleep? If it's bad I'll sleep with my hearing aids in and if it's at the worst i only sleep in daylight or when my husband is awake.Another irrational thought I've always had is the shower. I couldn't hear if someone broke in then, and ever since i was a child I've always thought \"well i wouldn't hear a fire alarm so i guess I'll just die.\" When that's at it's worst i wait till my husband gets home to shower. I know these are completely irrational thoughts because the likelihood of them happening is extremely rare, but i honestly feel more vulnerable because I'm deaf? Anyone else have these thoughts? \n",

No one also takes me seriously when I've told them that I've been discriminated in jobs because of my deafness (fired and passed over for promotion for example), they just assume that something is wrong with my personality because with hearing aids -- I shouldn't come across as deaf but in the same league as the Hearing people.I don't have support in the deaf communities either because in their eyes I'm not deaf enough.  I've made many attempts to be part of deaf culture only to get the cold shoulder when they find out that I was raised orally only, and cannot sign anything but the alphabet.  The mere fact that I was raised hearing even with severe hearing loss irritates them.I'm between a rock and a hard place, I feel isolated and not accepted my either communities.  Either I'm not hearing enough, or I'm not deaf enough.  It's gotten to the point where hearing people suggested that I apply for Disability for being deaf (I do meet the dB requirement, just not word discrimination), and deaf people are getting angry with me stating that I'm not \"disabled/deaf enough\" to even apply!I've been raised Hearing but want to be part of deaf culture as the years go by...sometimes I wish I was severe to profoundly deaf rather than moderate to severe... maybe then I'll be accepted ;^; \n",

      "Would it be considered to refer to myself as hard of hearing? I have APD. Details inside **Background:** I posted a few weeks ago about the fact that my GP thought I was losing my hearing in the mid-range frequencies due to me not being able to understand speech when there's background noise. So I went to a neurotologist and audiologist. Turns out my ears themselves are fine. My inability to understand speech in noise is apparently caused by auditory processing disorder (APD)--my brain is at fault here (yay traumatic brain injuries).Anyways, the result is either that I can't understand people when there's background noise or I can, but with difficulty. Depends on the amount/type of noise, how much my lipreading skill as progressed, and whether or not I can see their lips. I'm constantly having to tell people to wait til the noise has passed, or that they need to face me when talking. (And then sometimes they start speaking exaggeratedly slow and I can't read their lips... grrr...) Basically my experience with speech in noise is similar to that of many people who are HoH.**My question:** Would it be offensive if I referred to myself as HoH when explaining to a random person that I can't understand what they're saying/that they need to face me when speaking in a crowd? I've already explained APD to everyone close to me/everyone that I interact with in noisy areas on a regular basis, so that's covered. I'm asking more about encounters with waiters and such--people who I'm only going to interact with briefly/once or twice. Very often they don't know what auditory processing disorder is (not their fault!), and then I have to explain what it is and I feel like I'm wasting my time and theirs. But if I say I'm hard of hearing, they understand right away. I'm not sure if that's considered offensive or a faux pas by the D/deaf and HoH community, though. If it is, I'll stop. Thoughts? \n",

      "Does anyone who's had an enucleation also deal with intense dryness in nose area? Hi! I'm not sure where else to post this, so if I'm in the wrong place, please let me know!I had my left eye removed via enucleation at the age of 16 after an accident (which, now that I'm thinking, I don't know if I even needed the entire eye removed and that I was just scared about that very rare \"sympathetic ophthalmia\", but that's a frustration for another day and I can't turn back time).Only recently have I been having a very dry, sharp feeling when breathing through my left nostril (the same side of my face where my eye was removed). I really, really don't recall this being an issue throughout the remainder of high school, or during college. It's only been a thing (I think) since 2020 til now (I am currently 24).The sharp, dry feeling, when bad enough, causes me to have headaches, but only on the left side of my head. I'm not sure how to really describe the process, but it's like the air I'm breathing through my left nostril feels colder than the I air I breathe through my right nostril. I feel it down the left side of my throat. It's becoming a more noticeable issue since it's closer to wintertime, but I'm worried about the root of the issue (whatever that may be) because I'm moving further north for school soon, and it's a lot colder than where I am now.I'm not sure if this is related to having an ocular prosthesis or if this is related to having an enucleation in general, but I just wanted to ask if anyone else like me has had this same issue (just to rule it out if it turns out it's something else entirely). I've tried searching through the losteye forum or other general websites about eye removal and if anyone suffers sinus/breathing issues because of it. I don't know if it has to do with that area of my face being generally \"emptier\" because of the lack of eye. Is the eye area connected in any significant way to the nose/sinus area? I don't think it's allergies because I don't have allergies. It's just related to cold, dry air. (I've had two CT scans about it, but they both confirmed that nothing's wrong with my sinuses, so I feel like banging my head against the wall because I don't know what the problem is!)So, again, apologies if this is the wrong place to ask (but I'm not sure if this could be related to my visual impairment. I don't have weird breathing issues on the right side of my face). Sorry if this reads a little too venty, but I wanted to be as descriptive as possible. If anyone has ever had their eye removed via enucleation, do you suffer a persistent and uncomfortable dryness when breathing, but only on the side of your face where they eye was removed? I would really appreciate any answer, even if it's a \"no\" because then that'll tell me to go down a different research path. Thank you in advance!(Also, based on the rules, I don't think this qualifies as a medical advice question. I'm just wondering if anyone else has this issue. I have gone to the doctor twice about it, so I just wanted to make sure I'm even asking the right questions before I go in for a third time.) \n",

Can I work as a dishwasher? \n",

      "What's your strategy for dealing with calls from unknown numbers? I have a cell phone number that is supposed to be text-only, but there's no way to stop spammers or people with the wrong numbers from calling it. So when a call shows up, I usually google the number to see who it is. If it's a noted spammer, I block them. If it's someone with the wrong number, I usually call them via my VP and tell them that they have the wrong number. This works most of the time, except for this one case whose number was busy every time I tried to call to explain. I ended up blocking them.What's your strategy for dealing with unwanted voice calls? \n",

      "Rant about substitute teacher I am high school student with a hearing loss. It started two years ago and now I wear hearing aids (lots of us here know how imperfect those are). I had sub in my finance classes (2 classes with teacher same) and she was the worst substitute I ever experience. I tried to give her my microphone that Bluetooth my hearing aids and she told me she “was not comfortable with”. I try to explain reasons I need it, but she refused. Later in class, I am on my phone app to change the settings on my hearing aids. The sub comes right up behind me to say “did you not hear my announcement? No phones.” She did not care about my 504 plan and accommodations to be able to can use my phone. The class was allowed to use phone only for music, nothing else like adjust settings to focus on my project partner’s speech.The next class I have with her, I asked a question to the hearing girl next to me, so I use my voice. The sub rushes over to tell me to be quieter and less distracting. She said I was disrupting the whole class by yelling. I say “I am deaf, I can’t tell how loud I am. I apologize for distracting anyone.” She wrote my name down note for the teacher to have conversation with me. Conclusion: I was marked tardy, why? I did not hear her call my name for attendance in two classes. I might have discipline when I go back on Monday for being too loud. I know my teacher will not follow through with discipline for me, but still. I was embarrassed and upset. Amongst other things she got angry with me for like fidgeting with my hands etc. \n",

      "How do you cope with lack of sleep? I’ve always struggled with sleep, but lately it’s been really bad. I’ve got RP and I always see what looks like static snow. Millions of little black and white dots. Lately the dots have felt more erratic, swarming round like little bees. It’s as if I can see every particle in the air, zooming round none stop. It’s so distracting. But it also makes me feel like I’m in some sort of limbo between day and night. I’m scared of darkness and yet the time I want it, trying to sleep, it doesn’t come. The dots are so distracting, it makes it impossible to relax. How do you cope with it? I want to work so badly but I know if I ever actually do find something (which I’m trying very hard to do) that it’s going to play havoc with me feeling so tired and having to get up at times for shifts. I know some people will say just find jobs that accommodate my sleep pattern but it’s hard enough trying to find a job without also then having to find even more accommodations to just the blindness. I don’t get to spend as much time with my partner as I’d like. We don’t get to spend as much time together as we’d like but then when we do I’m sleeping in until 1s or 2s or 3s because I’m not getting to sleep until 6 or 7s in the mornings and it’s really making me feel shit that I’m not getting to spend the limited time we have together actually with her. I don’t like complaining about it to my family or anything because they’re actually working jobs and have a right to feel tired. It appears to everyone else that I just have a poor routine. I’ve seen a neurologist, they monitored me and told me that I have a free running sleep cycle and if it doesn’t respond to melatonin (which didn’t work) then there’s not really much they can do. Said that if I do start working they’d maybe look at sedatives or something. But it’s affecting how shit I feel on a daily basis. Just seeing how many other people struggle with this. \n",

      "Spiraling into Depression due to sudden hearing loss I've always been deaf. But I learned to talk and I refused to learn to sign (there was no one to sign with) and I used the technology and refused the cochlear implant and all that.I had a really bad sinus infection, double ear infection, ruptured both eardrums, just overall really deep bad infection for two months.It destroyed the rest of my hearing. I am at a complete loss. They have me on prednisone in the hopes I can be in the 1% group that it can be reversed but the ENT said it was unlikely because the infection was so bad and I had it for a while. I play keyboard. I love music. I can't even hear my husband's voice anymore. I'm thinking of the future, when babies come and I won't be able to hear them laugh. I worked so hard to be a part of the hearing world, that I am so depressed and grieving over everything I realize I am losing. The last time I heard my parents' voice. I can't hear the wind anymore. The birds. I realize it is not the end of the world and I have options available to me. But the grief is so overwhelming, I can't get control of it. Some of it might be the prednisone amplifying it, but even still. Help. \n",

      "How has your deafness affected your academic advancement and social life? I was born in Afghanistan. You might know this but, Afghanistan is a country with a huge rate of illiteracy. People in such countries can be assholes, especially when it comes to their treatment of physically (and mentally) impaired people. I lost my hearing at around 16 years of age. I did have and impaired hearing before that, but it got substantial at this age. It made me isolated and I went through lots of belittling treatments. I became depressed and hateful of life and society and didn’t make any academic progress. I came to Australia a few years ago. My hope was that once I came here I wouldn’t experience the torturous isolations I experienced in my 3rd world country. That, I would be able to study what I wanted to and make progress in it. My life has changed in so many ways but I haven’t been making any progress. I can’t hear anything in the class. I was under 25 when I came here and since the government helps young, disabled people, I was given a hearing aid. It was a very low-quality hearing aid and I hated using it, not that I am ungrateful for the help. It was big and too un-nuanced to help. Loud but tactless. After a while I threw the hearing aid away. I have thought at times that one of the reasons I didn’t like the hearing aid might have been that it was too conspicuous and reminded me of my standing out and triggered that shame that you usually develop when you live amongst people who think ill of you because of your hearing loss. Anyway, I enrolled in a university (UQ) in a good school and … wait for it… started failing in all of my classes. I tried and tried and never got anywhere. Part of it was that I was so depressed and anxious. Being brown and Asian and so old amongst teenagers with huge, unchallenged ego (I am 30 now) and so many other things and on the top of these all being deaf made me a miserable little beast. I have taken a break from my university and my enrolment has been cancelled because my GPA was so low. I still want to study but I am afraid of failing. I haven’t told anybody about my failures. It is shame that I keep secret. This is not a story told to inspire pity in your hearts, it is a question: does your hearing loss affect your social and academic life? How do you deal with it? Is it because I am not hard-working enough, inspired enough, enthusiastic enough, motivated enough to succeed or are all of my failures is just a complex snowball that I can’t crack? \n",

      "My blog post about Non-24-hour Sleep Disorder I wrorte this on my own subreddit, but wanted to share it here for any feedback. I've copied the text because crossposting isn't allowed from NSFW communities. Something a lot of blind people deal with is sleep disorders, the most common being Non-24-hour sleep disorder, where your brain releases the sleep and wake chemicals at the wrong times of day because it isn't able to regulate itself, usually because of the lack of vitamin D reception from sunlight, and the ability to actually see the rise and set of the sun, thus having your brain be able to tell night from day. All this to say it is a huge, huge struggle for me. No matter when I go to bed the night before, or how much sleep I get, during the day I am pretty much useless. This effects my ability to get anything done around the house, it effects my ability to create content, it even effects my ability to carry on conversation's at times, because I'm literally dozing off while speaking. And what's even worse is, it's frustrating not only to me but the people around me who actually have full-time jobs and have more reason to be tired than me. I try to force myself to stand up, to move around, and I just can't. And the more I try to explain it, the more stupid and lazy I sound. How the fuck do I even start to make the changes I need to make in my life if I'm literally exhausted for no reason other than chemicals in my brain for 80 percent of my day? I physically can't drink anymore caffine to keep me at the level of consciousness I'm at now. What the hell do I do? \n",

      "Am I the only one who gets accused of faking being visually impaired? I was out on a date Saturday night at a bar. I got separated from my party and couldn't find our table. What i typically try to do in this situation is make myself as visually apparent as possible so someone I know can spot me and come and get me. I was using my cane to navigate. But I guess I walked past this group of guys one time too many. I could overhear them talking to each other about me. They were very concerned. But not about me. One of the guys came over and started yelling at me. His opening line was something like, \"stop making fun of blind people you f* a**hole.\" If he'd ask me what my issue was I would probably have explained it to him. But he just wanted a fight. A lot of my frustration is that I get accused of faking a few times a year. It's just nobody's business. But each time it happens I lose more patience. So I got back in this face and started telling him off. I mentioned that if I was in a wheelchair and stood up he wouldn't dare make a comment. I think he was shocked at first. Then he got back in my face and started yelling back. If he took a swing it would have been a freebie sucker punch because I couldn't have seen it coming. But that didn't stop me.  Some people got between us and broke it up. I half expected to get bounced. It kinda made the rest of the night awkward and we left soon after. Just not sure if I'm the only one this happens to. I'm visually impaired, night blind, legally blind. I have to use the cane to get around at night. I just don't get why people keep getting in my face.What benefit do they think I'm getting? Why would I fake it?  \n",

      "Constant accusation of faking even though i'm not i'm an 18 year old nonbinary person. I am blind, I don't know exactly why, except when I had one doctor say he saw macular degeneration and significantly high myopia in my eyes. I am consistantly accused of faking, even by doctors, and especially my parents. I have a history of mental illness, granted. But never any kind of hypocondriac type stuff, in fact I hid my vision loss for a year and a half before I voiced the concern. I have had numerous scans and tests and all of the eye tests you can imagine done to me. They all come back with the macular degeneration and myopia. I am still kindly told as gently as possible i'm obviously lying.Why would anyone fake vision loss? Attention? Maybe. But I cannot think of any real reason why anybody would do this to themselves, why anybody would put themselves in such a restrictive and hellish position. I can't imagine just waking up and telling everybody i'm blind because I think it's just the most fun and cool thing to do. No, I'm losing my prime and going insane in my apartment because I can't find a job that will work with my visual impairment, and I can't drive myself anywhere. I'm feeling everyone I love drift away from me because who wants to deal with a blind person? My parents don't believe me and think i'm sick in the head and think this is all one big scam.the worst part is truly not knowing why. I've searched my symptoms online, but don't feel i'm qualified in any manner to make those kind of assumptions about myself when it comes to diseases and disorders. But 5 or 6 truly qualified professionials don't believe me. I know this isn't in my head and I know i'm not actively faking it. But nobody else will even consider me. I'm in hell and at a loss honestly. I feel like I deserve some way to get better, or some way to adapt to life this way. I have a cane that I use sometimes, but I'm always terrified that a parent will see me and lose their mind and condemn me for looking for attention. But I only ever practice with it on an isolated nature trail and in the grocery store so I won't be looked at being an embarrassment to everybody.I'm sorry for the wall of text. I'm just at the end of my rope and just want this to be over. \n",

      "Feeling incredibly disappointed with Rick Riordan’s deaf rep No spoilers for the book, only brief mentions of the deaf side character. As some of you may know, I’m the curator of an ongoing list that ranks deaf characters in fiction based on factual accuracy (physiology, ontoepistemology, sociohistorical contexts, etc.) and message(s) underlying the character(s). Most of the representations are not great. But I did see great reviews for Rick Riordan’s Magnus Chase trilogy, many of which specifically mention how well-done his deaf character, Hearth, is. I’ve been saving this trilogy to read to read when I was tired of poor reps in other works. I just finished Stephen King’s The Stand, which was awful, and so picked up Magnus Chase expecting some relief. I’m about halfway through book one, and I am painfully disappointed. Usually I go into a story by a hearing author assuming the deaf character will be stereotypical, inspoporny, and/or inaccurate. But this time I let myself be lulled into thinking that this would be an enjoyable read and an easy review to write. It’s honestly soul-crushing, especially because this was published in 2015, and Riordan seems like the kind of author to do their research. He failed here. Hard. I’m disappointed in myself as well. I bought the full trilogy on my erroneous assumption, and that was a waste because I will not be reading the next two books. The oversimplification of ASL is bad enough on its own, but the signing is also rife with basic errors (the sign for REMOVE somehow means [you] GET OUT [of here]?), and Magnus somehow becomes an expert interpreter within a few minutes but still needs repetitions and clarifications for Norse words, among other issues. Hearth himself is one of those totally deaf individuals who can magically speechread everyone in any situation, no matter how much facial hair someone has or whether they’re running for their lives, or huddled together in the darkness. Of course hearing fans would praise this “amazing” inclusion. Why would I ever think hearing reviewers could spot a good deaf rep? That was one of my biggest reasons for starting my ranked list in the first place. Ugh! Sigh! I need to sleep for a week to recover from this disappointment. \n",

      "Vet School Drop Out? (Kind of a Rant...sorry) So I was born with uncorrectable vision past 20/60 and a severe color deficiency.My childhood was peppered with a lot of \"nevers\" because of it. I was told I'd never drive a car or play a sport and let's forget about doing anything meaningful with my life because teachers never expected anything out of me and always treated me like I was the most inconvenient person to educate. But eventually, I waded through metric tons of that bullshit to go to college, graduate Phi Beta Kappa with a B.S. in Neuroscience, and get into what is arguably the best veterinary school in the world.I've worked so hard to get here. For most of my life, having low vision was \"the big problem\" and being colorblind was like, the lesser issue. But in vet school, everything is color coded. Histology is all done with different color stains and you can't even do a basic physical exam on your patient without remarking on the exact shade of its gums or eyeballs or [insert mucous membrane here]. Having uncorrectable low vision turned out to be an almost non-issue. (I mean, you can get close enough to anything right?) But being colorblind? That's apparently a BFD. And I'm worried that I'm going to go through four years of very expensive vet school and not be able to practice. And like, I know there are some colorblind doctors, but I'm realllllllly fucking colorblind. Like when I'm looking at histo slides, everything is the same color, and when a professor points out a discoloration on a dog (like a rash, or bloodshot eyes) I usually can't see it. I don't feel comfortable evaluating anything. And I'm afraid that if they let me graduate from here (and they will, because I'm paying them lots of money to be a student for four years) that I'm going to end up killing my patients, or requiring an aide to tell me what color shit is and therefore not getting hired anywhere. I mean things being as they are, I wouldn't trust me to examine and treat my own dog. I've only been here a month, but feel like I should just drop out and try to enroll in a program that doesn't require decent vision. But I've worked so hard to be here, and I'm so close, and I just can't believe that something that was barely an issue my entire life is going to stop me from being the doctor I've wanted to be since I was a teenager. And i'm feeling lost and angry and just miserable about it. And I really needed to rant. Thanks for reading this whole thing if you did.Side Note: I know that my visual issues are small potatoes compared to some people on this subreddit and I'm sorry if it seems like I'm complaining about a physical condition that I know a lot of people here would be thrilled to be in. I'm not trying to be ungrateful, I'm just really upset right now.  \n",

      "[update] Opinion on not learning sign language? Original thread here :  month ago I asked for your opinions on raising a deaf kid without any sign language following the birth of my deaf and only niece in a hearing family (even all the extended family is hearing). My sister (a speech therapist) intended to go oralist only (which I vaguely remembered wasn't a great idea) and at the time was shutting out the entire world and only talking to my parents who were pretty much acting as in mourning. And I was looking about the opinion of Deaf people and scientific litterature in French (since I'm the only one in my family that can read English).So update time!French scientific litterature on the  subject of bilingual education for the Deaf is really bloody hard to find! But I did manage to find some. I wrote to a researcher at Gallaudet who is from Quebec and he gave me contacts. I followed some clues people on this sub gave me. I got some papers from Gallaudet, McGill's (Montreal) and Neuchâtel (Switzerland).Overall, it says that ASL and LSQ (langue des signes québécoise) are actual languages which wasn't a big surprise to me and that bilingual education is best.So that's it for the research part and thanks to those here who gave me pointers.My parents stopped crying over their first grand-daugther being deaf (and I'm saying that in the most litterate sense). My mother two weeks ago was still crying because she won't be able to sing for her grand-daugther (that side of the family is full of terrific singers, I didn't inherit that at all) and that she won't be able to read her stories. When I was a kid, she read *hundreds* of stories and tales to me (side effects of reading so many stories to your kid include a complete inability to believe in santa because it sounds too similar to stories) and she think she won't be able to do that with her grand-daugther. I think that's not the case.My sister came out of isolation and I could call her. She talked pretty much the whole time and I didn't say much at all. She was relatively cheerful.I looked for an LSQ night class. It starts in May. Teachers are all Deaf and classes are silent from day 1. It includes some reading on Deaf culture outside of class. It's cheap (and put it in my taxes so it's even cheaper). There's a field trip at some point and I don't know where we're going but I think it's exciting because no class I took since I finished high school 15 years ago included field trips. :) Anyway, it looks fun, I'm looking forward to it.I told my mother about what I found out and that I will take a sign class. She told my sister. Shit hit the fan.In no particular order because that came in a whirlwind:- She asked me if it's true that I believe that bilingual education is best. She's angry that I do. I offer scientific litterature. I suggested she asks actual Deaf people. She's quite against both.- She thinks that Signs are useless now that CIs exist.- She thinks that pretty much all Deaf people hate any Deaf person with a CI because it's a threat to their useless language (her words)- She doesn't want her kid to learn Signs because to do so she would have to be in contact with other Deaf people (it's at that point I started to suspect she hates the Deaf)- She claims every specialist she saw told her that it's bad to teach Signs and we should only ever go with oralism. I doubt they *all* said that but Quebec City is still the only city in North America to a have a Deaf school that's oralist only so maybe oralism is more popular there... It brings to the next point...- She doesn't want her daugther to go to that school and believe she absolutely must be mainstreamed (probably once again so she doesn't see other Deaf people)- She thinks the Deaf population is getting old (that one's just bizarre, Deaf people are born all the time. Case in point...)- She pretty much takes my LSQ classes as a war declaration. She tried very hard to convince me it's useless and not to take it. I think she takes it pretty much as a war declaration...- She's very afraid that CIs will prevent her daugther to be cured when a cure for deafness is discovered.- But she still will teach her daugther baby signs so there's thatI didn't talk to her since that conversation yesterday and I don't think she'll talk to me for a while. I still haven't processed the WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK yet which is probably why I'm writing this.Seriously... WTF... \n",

      "Is it selfish to hate hearing sounds? I've been around 50% deaf since birth, but it's gotten worse in recent years so I'm not sure exactly where I'm at now.  I wore aids as a child but always hated them, no correction since 1986.  Don't know sign, was never taught and my late attempts to learn haven't panned out.  I don't like noise, I keep my world as silent as possible most of the time.   My family says I'm selfish for not wanting to wear an amplifier when I'm around them, and that it's very frustrating to talk to me because they have to repeat things.  I guess they're right and I know I do miss a lot, but I just hate noise so much.  I have a Pocket Talker that I bought but rarely use, sure I can hear voices with it, but I can also hear EVERYTHING else.  I really hate using it.  And even with amplification, I still rely at least partially on lip reading for comprehension.  (I have 2 coworkers and I do okay with them, but my family is very soft spoken.)  To clarify, I'm looking for opinion here, not justification. I just don't know where else to ask such a thing.  Am I selfish?  Should I just suck it up and try to deal?  Or... I don't even know what the options are. \n",

      "I'm a sighted person, but I just got to witness a \"Let me pray for your sight\" in the wild. I'm devastated. If this isn't allowed, then the mods can delete it, but I don't know where else this would go. I'm fully sighted, on the autism spectrum, and a Christian. I also have OCD and from time to time I get this obsessive worry that I'm going to go blind from something or other, whether it's a random infection or an accident. It's irrational and I'm getting treatment for it, but during the times when my mental health was really bad I lurked on this sub because some part of me thought that if I could \"prepare\" for the experience I could handle the grief and tragedy that everyone who lost sight later in life had to inevitably face. So I learned about a lot of things your community has to endure, but the one that broke my heart was all of the dehumanization and condescension that ignorant sighted people give to blind people. From ridiculous things like getting it confused with deafness, asking how you wipe your ass, thinking your cane is a weapon, it was all just incredibly rude bullshit I know I'd hate to put up with. I have temper issues and get angered or depressed due to anxiety very easily. I think the one thing that scared me about being blind even more than the practical problems was how other people would treat me.I have a close friend who is completely blind due to physical trauma severing her optic nerve at a young age. I met her in college before my OCD ever got really bad, and nowadays I don't talk about whatever's bothering me much since no one really seems to get it outside of my therapist. She's been my most loyal friend and I've felt like more than anyone else in my life she \"gets\" a lot of my issues even if she's never experienced them herself (she doesn't have any mental health conditions, though). So whenever she talks about dealing with difficult people I get mad that someone's been treating my friend that way.I heard a lot of stories of the \"Let me pray for you,\" variety from well-meaning but ignorant Christians and it's so embarrassing to me as a Christian. I want to take the opportunity to apologize on behalf of my fellow Christians for their completely inappropriate behavior and lack of understanding of why disabled people are even healed at all in the Gospels (which is another subject not meant for this thread) and why it doesn't happen anymore. I don't fully know the answers to these questions myself, but my relationship with Jesus was never contingent on Him healing me, even though I've got several debilitating conditions myself.But I always thought the \"Let me pray for you\" stuff was just exaggerated on Reddit. I didn't think I'd actually witness it. But today I did.We were with our church (as far as I know nobody at my church has ever asked that infamous question) volunteering at a soup kitchen. I was entering data in a computer (not really what I had expected to be doing but I was doing it nevertheless) and I could overhear what was going on in the next room. My friend had arrived a bit later than everyone else (someone else from church took her) and I hadn't expected her at all. She's very much into volunteering when she can, and I never asked her how she had to go about doing that when most people are unfamiliar with blind people and probably automatically assume they can't help out with anything. We had gotten most of the work done much quicker than we had expected so there wasn't much for her to do anyway. Regardless, someone from the soup kitchen approached and talked to her. I was too focused on my work to listen to most of the conversation, but I heard what the worst of it. I'm not even sure if the guy asked \"Can I pray for you?\" so much as insisted on praying anyway, and then of course asking in a piteous tone how she had lost her sight.My friend came to see me when she was told I was working in the back and I told her I had heard what happened. She assured me I didn't need to be bothered by it because she was used to it and just felt more awkward than angry. Well, since it's the first time I've seen it happen I'm just incredibly disappointed to find out that what you guys were saying is true. I was hoping this was just a rare occurrence. Honestly, how my friend can even still be a Christian after having to put up with things like that all the time. I hate that a few Christians somewhere have done something that makes whole groups of people resent Christianity because the Christians focused more on this literalist, simplistic understanding of a few cherry-picked Scriptures rather than actually looking at real life and realizing that Christ's kingdom isn't just about winning souls, but bringing forth a kingdom of God and humanity working together to restore the world to the perfect creation it was always meant to be, and sometimes the miracles just aren't meant to happen in this life. There's dozens of issues I have that I'd certainly like to be miraculously healed of, but I trust God to have His own reasons for shaping my life the way He did. It's not always easy but I endure because I have hope in something better.I apologize if me as a sighted person getting upset on my friend's behalf is somehow inappropriate. I'm willing to be corrected on how to better react if need be. I'm just crushed that I actually got to see the kind of thing that makes Redditors dislike Christianity, because I thought that I'd never witness it. \n",
